Von Brandenstein (1970:3, PMS 2140) says that Njaginjagi (A1) is 'a blend of Ngadju A3 and Nungar W41', but  according to Theiberger (1993) von Brandenstein (p.c.) suggested that Nyaki Nyaki is related to Kalaamay A4, which he says 'is definitely not a dialect of Noongar W41'.",

Glass also notes that the term Wangkatja is confusing, 'because all the Western Desert speaking Aborigines of the Eastern Goldfields and surrounding desert areas call themselves Wangkatja'.\n\nTindale's Pindiini may be equivalent to Wangkatja A103 or Wangkatha A12  -  he lists Wanggada as an alternative name of Pindiini A102. Between Pindiini and Wangkatha, Tindale's map shows two other groups, Murunitja A8 and Tjeraridjal A7, but the validity of these groups is uncertain.

        "language_comment": "The status of Widi with respect to the name Wirtimaya (and variants Witimay, Widimay) has been unclear. Some sources have treated them as the same (Wurm 1972, Thieberger 1993) while others only use one form (O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin 1966 and Capell 1963 use Widi) or the other (Walsh 1981 and Wurm 1994 use 'Wirdimay', Douglas 1976 uses Witimay (wirdimai), and von Brandenstein 1991 and Douglas 1981 use Wirtimaya).\n\nOates and Oates (1970:59) list 'Witimay' as an alternative name of Widi (A13) but Oates (1975:89) treats Wirtimay as a distinct variety. Of Widi, Oates (1975:87) comments that Douglas treats it as part of Watjarri A39, whereas Wirtimay is listed as a Njungar W41 variety. Douglas (1981 and MS 1369) comments that 'Wirtimaya' was called 'Watjanmay' by the Nyungars W41.\nHowever, Douglas's 1976 map locates 'Watjanmay' south-east of Patimay A14 while his 1981 map locates 'Wirtimaya' north-west of Patimaya A14.\n\nThe identity of Widi with respect to other language names has also been uncertain.\n\nAccording to the WA Handbook, the comparison of Badimaya A14 vocabulary to Widi vocabulary by Morphy (1985, 'Working notes on Western Australian languages') suggests they are two separate languages. On the other hand, Marmion's view (2007 p.c.) is that 'Widi' (Wirtimaya, Wirdimaya or Wirdi) as far as it refers to a language is another name for Badimaya A14, based on the word for 'no', 'wirdi'. Widi may refer in particular to the western Badimaya (around Mingenew and Morowa), where it might have been a name used by the coastal neighbours to refer to the Badimaya.\n\nO'Grady et al. (1966) treat Cheangwa A97 as an alternative name of Widi while Tindale treats Nanakati A93 as an alternative name of Widi. These are names Blevins (2001) refers to as possible languages spoken in the area between the eastern extent of Nhanda W13 and the western extent of Badimaya A14.\n\nIn this database, Widi and Widimay/Wirtimaya etc. are treated as alternative names of the one language, while Cheangwa A97, Nhanhagardi A93, Badimaya / Badimia A14 and Wajarri / Wadjarri are treated as separate languages.",

However, the territory around Lake Moore/Ninghan is attested, as my informant, Mr Joe Benjamin, can trace site ownership back three generations. Today, the Madimaya are scattered in towns throughout the Murchison Region in Mullewa, Cue, Mingenew, Mt Magnet, Yalgoo, Carnarvon, and Meekatharra. There are many people remaining of Badimaya descent, but if they speak a traditional language, it is usually Watjarri, otherwise known as the 'Murchison' or 'Yamadyi' language, which has become the dominant language of the region (Dunn 1988:20).\n\nAt Cue, Nannine, Mount Magnet; southwest almost to Yalgoo, northwestern boundary is on Sandford River divide (Tindale 1974).",

However, Tindale lists Nagatadjara (A17) as a separate group and locates them north-east of Wangkatja A103. It appears that Nyanganyatjarra is a sub-set of Wangkatja ... Oates (1975:111), citing Glass and Hackett, says that Njanganjadjara (A17) was originally at Mt Margaret, Wangkatja country, but its present location is north-east of Laverton.\n\nA number of items with 'in Ngaanyatjarra' A38 in their titles are described as being on Nangadadjara / Nyanganyatjara in MURA (hence the question marks for the documentation score).

Tindale (1974:243) reports that malba means 'circumcised and subincised ones' and is a 'name applied by Wudjari W41 to (Kalaako) and other immediately northern tribes'. However, von Brandenstein (1980:2) says it means 'man' and identifies it as one of six language varieties in the Dundas District area (the others being Mirning (Eucla) A9, Fraser Range A74, Norseman A99, Windaga A111 and Kallaagu (A2), commenting that 'it will be difficult to extract the different components of the (Dundas District) languages (...) from the mixed language now called Ngadju A3 which is still spoken'.",

Ngatjumay in Douglas (1968) appears to be the equivalent of von Brandenstein's Ngadju.\n\nSue Hanson (Wangka Maya PALC 2008) mentions an unpublished sketch grammar written by Steven Roberts. Doug Marmion (2013 p.c.) advises that this is actually a reanalysis of von Brandenstein 1980 using a more standard linguistic approach.\n\nOates (1975) gives Marlba (A110 in this database) as an equivalent to Ngadjunma (A3) and Tindale (1974) includes Malba as an alternative name for not only Ngadjunmaia (A3) but also Kalaako A2 and Kalamaia A4.\nMarmion (p.c.)  mentions that Ngajumaya speakers say that their language should be called 'Marlpamaya', and that this may be adopted at some point in the near future.",

Oates says that Bates reported two dialects of Ngaiawonga (A30): a northern dialect, north of Wiluna, and a southern dialect associated with Lake Way, Wiluna, Mt Sir Samuel and Lawler's Range. Bates's analysis was informed by a body of some texts and a 100-word vocabulary she collected. Oates ventures that Bidungu A40 may be the cover term and Ngaiawanga and Ngadawanga the names of the dialects, though she also notes that Hudson believes Bidungu A40 to be only a geographical term.\n\nNote, though, that other dialects are reported for Birdungu. See A40 for details.",

Capell's Linguistic Survey (1963) lists the last of these, Mangu/'Ma?'u.\n\nIt seems that the only data available on Mangu comprises three pronouns listed by Brown (MS 1349), who does not quote the source and says 'precise location unknown, but probably somewhere in central WA'. On Berndt's map (1942), 'Ma?'u (A34) is west of Lake Nabberu and Lake Gregory, not west of Laverton as stated in his text (1942:328). Mangu might be a mishearing of Marrngu, a group name covering languages found north of Lake Gregory, such as Nyangumarta A61, and Brown's data may be from one or a combination of Marrngu languages. Thieberger lists Mangu as a name associated with Western Desert A80 language (1993: 397).",

        "language_comment": "There appear to be several dialects of Wajarri / Wadjarri though the details are uncertain.\n\nAccording to Vaso Elefsiniotis of the Irra Wangga - Geraldton Language Program (2007 p.c.), the current understanding is that there are five recognised dialects of Wajarri (A39): Byro Wajarri in the east around Byro plains; Boolardy or central Wajarri around Boolardy/Wooleen stations; Ngunuru Wajarri around Belele station; Birdungu Wajarri to the north-east of Boolardy where the Murchison and Gascoyne Rivers begin; and Nharnu Wajarri. Elefsiniotis also comments that Birdungu is the name given by others to the Wajarri people who traditionally lived at the eastern or north-eastern boundary of Wajarri country, depending on the observer's perspective.\n\nAccording to Marmion (1996:6-7) there are at least three dialects of Wajarri (A39). The dialect which covers most of Wajarri country appears to have no particular name other than Wajarri (Marmion uses 'Southern Wajarri' (and occasionally 'Central Wajarri') to disambiguate it from other varieties). The other two are Nhugarn A71 and Birdungu A40. Marmion (2007 p.c.) later says that Birdungu A40 is a compass term and is used to refer to people from around Meekatharra who are not Wajarri (or at least, not central Wajarri). \n\nThe Bundiyarra Aboriginal Community Aboriginal Corporation web site lists 'some' of the Wajarri (A39) dialects as Birdungu A40, Nharnu A115, Nhugarn A71, Byro A113, Mileura A114 and Ngunuru A112.\n\nMarmion (2015 p.c.) notes that in more recent times Wajarri (A39) varieties have been referred to by station names in the area, such as Byro station and Mileura station. In this way, some names may exist in parallel with older names: Byro Wajarri A113 is probably equivalent to Nhugarn A71, Mileura Wajarri A114 to Ngunuru A112. He also notes the ambiguous nature of the name Birdungu, meaning 'easterners'. Marmion says that more recently it has been used to refer to Ngunuru A112 but that it may also include Nharnu A115, this likely being the case for von Brandenstein's use of the term.\n\nWatjanti (W13) may also be a dialect of Wajarri / Wadjarri. Douglas (1981:199) says that a comparison of Curr's Watchandie W13 data is obviously related to Watjarri (A39). Blevins (2001:3), though, says that Watchandi W13 is a dialect of Nhanda W14.\n\nMuliara (W18) is another possible dialect of Wajarri / Wadjarri. Marmion (2006 p.c.) says that mulyara means 'east' and it could refer to a dialect of Wajarri A39 or a Western Desert language A80 variety, based on what Tindale (1974) and Douglas (1981) say.\n\nJaburu (W55) has also been linked to Wajarri / Wadjarri as a dialect, though its identity is uncertain as the name means 'north' in many languages of area.\n\nDixon (2002) lists Ngarluwangka as a possible dialect of Watjarri (A39) but notes that it may be a separate language. This may in fact be Ngarla A48, previously known as Ngarlawangka. The locations appear to be adjacent.",

        "language_comment": "The name Bidungu and its alternatives have been treated in different ways, apparently because Bidungu is a compass term and the language/people it refers to differ depending on the context. That is, Bidungu may not refer to a specific language or dialect. Bates (1913) says 'beedungoo' in some groups denotes a point to the north-east and also applies to the natives living there, while O'Grady et al. (1966) list Bedengo (A40) as a dialect of the same language as Nyangumarda A61. According to von Brandenstein (MS 1746, in Thieberger 1993), Pidungu (A40) has at least three dialects. Seen from Peak Hill, they are Ngarrka (east), Kurdun (west) and Yirrakalan (south but north of Meekatharra). There appears to be no language data supplied for these dialects. However, Oates and Oates (1970) also make reference to Ngarrga(warngga) as a dialect of Bedengo (A40) (though the other two names are not mentioned) and say that von Brandenstein collected vocabulary. According to Oates (1975) (who refers to A40 as 'Bidungu/Ngayawanga/Ngadawanga'), von Brandenstein reported Ngayawanga A30 as an alternative name of Bidungu (A40), a name which Daisy Bates equated with Ngadawanga A30. Oates says that Bates reported two dialects of Ngaiawonga A30: a northern dialect, north of Wiluna, and a southern dialect associated with Lake Way, Wiluna, Mt Sir Samuel and Lawler's Range. Bates's analysis was informed by a body of some texts and a 100-word vocabulary she collected. Oates ventures that Bidungu (A40) may be the cover term and Ngaiawanga and Ngadawanga the dialect names, though she also notes that Hudson believes Bidungu (A40) to be only a geographical term. On the other hand, Marmion (2005 p.c.) says that Birdungu is a Wajarri A39 word (at least in some dialects) which means 'east' or 'north-east' and is used to refer to people from around Meekatharra who are not central Wajarri A39. Marmion (1996, MS 4096) says that speakers of Birdungu are currently referring to themselves as Ngunuru A112. (Note that 'Ngoonooru' appears in a number of web pages about native title, though without reference to Birdungu.) Marmion (2015 p.c.) adds that Birdungu was usually used to refer to Ngunuru A112 but may also have encompassed Nharnu A115. He notes that von Brandenstein's use of the term Birdungu indicates Nharnu A115 and possibly also other, non-Wajarri language varieties. Note however that, according to Vaso Elefsiniotis, one dialect of Wajarri A39 is currently called Birdungu Wajarri. Elefsiniotis comments that Birdungu is the name given by others to the Wajarri people who traditionally lived at the eastern or north-eastern boundary of Wajarri country, depending on the observer's perspective. The Bundiyarra Aboriginal Community Aboriginal Corporation web site lists Birdungu and Ngunuru A112 as two distinct dialects of Wajarri A39 (in addition to other dialects: Nharnu A115, Nhugarn A71, Byro A113 and Mileura A114).\n",

The Peedongs go south of Shaw's 50 or 60 miles right on to the Murchison running up the river (both sides) to Peak Hill, and extend south as far as the Ord River. They run up the Ord river about 25 miles. From Peak Hill they go south to Wiluna about 25 miles, and here they come into a tribe that call themselves Ka-kara (east?) (Bates, 1993:4-5).\n",

An additional code, A79, was created when it became apparent that the two are likely distinct language varieties, but this was applied to Ngalawonga (now Ngarla).

There is an item in the AIATSIS collection (O'Grady 1957, MS 320) identified in the catalogue record as including information about Nugara (A5). The manuscript, 'Materials of suffixing languages of WA', contains language data attributed to the name Nju?ara.

Since then, many researchers have considered Nyiyaparli and Palyku to be very closely related languages or the same language. According to Dench (1998), 'all work to date suggests that Nyiyaparli and Palyku are different names for what is essentially the same language'.\n\nWangka Maya Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre was, as of 2008, conducting research to find out whether this is in fact the case. Their 2012 edition of the Nyiyaparli dictionary describes 'Palykutharri' (being the language of the Palyku) as a dialect of Nyiyaparli, along with Nankilakuthu A108, Martuyitha A109 (referred to as 'high' and 'low' dialects, respectively) and Ngulipartu A72, though the treatment of Ngulipartu and Palyku as dialects of Nyiyaparli is not widely reported among the sources. The dictionary contains details about these dialects including their locations.\n\nTindale (1974) lists Jana as an alternative name of Niabali (A50). However, Oates (1975:373) says that, from von Brandenstein's 1967 map, Jana appears to be part of Bidungu A40, which Oates equates with Ngaia-wangga A30.",

Since then, many researchers have considered Palyku and Nyiyaparli to be very closely related languages or the same language. According to Dench (1998), 'all work to date suggests that Nyiyaparli and Palyku are different names for what is essentially the same language'. Wangka Maya Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre was, as of 2008, conducting research to find out whether this is in fact the case. Their 2012 edition of the Nyiyaparli dictionary describes 'Palykutharri' (being the language of the Palyku A55) as a dialect of Nyiyaparli A50, along with Nankilakuthu A108, Martuyitha A109 and Ngulipartu (presumably Ngurlipartu A72, though this relationship is not confirmed elsewhere). The dictionary contains details about these dialect including their locations. The ABS does not make a distinction between Palyku and Nyiyaparli A50 and thus census data may combine information on both of these.\n",

Tindale places Maduwongga much further south than the location described for Martu Wangka. There is very little information available for Maduwongga. Note also that some sources (e.g. Oates 1975 and O'Grady et al. 1966) give Maduwonga as an alternative name for Gugada C3, while the location Tindale describes overlaps with the location of Wangkatha A12.\n\nMardo in Oates and Oates (1970:73) appears to correspond to Maduwongga (A6), based on the location of Mardo on their map, while Mardo in Oates (1975:374) seems to correspond to Martu Wangka A86 from the description given.\n\nPreviously both Maduwongga and Martu Wangka were assigned to the same code, A6, in the Thesaurus. They now have distinct authorised headings; A6 now relates only to Maduwongga and A86 is used for Martu Wangka. AUSTLANG previously had these codes reversed but this has been corrected to reflect the original assignment of A6 to Maduwongga.\n\nNote that the ABS does not make a distinction between Maduwongga and Martu Wangka A86 so census data may combine information on both. Thieberger (1993) includes Maduwongga in two Western Desert language A80 lists: Manjiljarra A51.1 and Kartujarra A51. ",

From a linguistic perspective, though, Sharp recognises only two distinct types of Nyangumarta, Ngurlipartu A72 and Walyirli A73, which she refers to as northern coastal Nyangumarta and southern inland Nyangumarta respectively. Geytenbeek says that O'Grady's (1964) 'Wanyarli' (one of two dialects of Nyangumarta, along with Ngurlipartu) was probably meant to be 'Walyirli' A73 (Wangka Maya PALC 2008).

Many of the northern Nyangumarta people occupied the Eighty Mile Beach area (Sharp 2004:4). In early historical time the Iparuka Njangamarda usurped the territory of the Ngolibardu tribe around Thros-sell Range. Including this, their territory extends from Rudall River northeast to ['Karbardi] near Swindell Field east of ['Tjandalkuru], (Tindalgoo on maps), thence west to near the eastern border of Warrawagine Station. The Kundal Njangamarda go from this line northwest to ['Man-da] (Munda Well on Munro Station) and west to Anna Plains Station, just south of Cape Missiessy, where ['Jawinja], situated beside the present Station homestead, was their northernmost water. Their southwestern boundary lay along the edge of the tableland north of de Grey and Oakover rivers to ['Jalalo] (Ulalling Hills on maps) (Tindale 1974). Great Sandy Desert, around Lake Waukarlykarly (near Telfer), and through Sandfire to Eighty Mile Beach along the Pilbara coast. (Geytenbeek 2011). Contemporary location: northern Pilbara and southern Kimberley areas. The area extends to La Grange (Bidyadanga) and Broome and south-west to Port Hedland Also Marble Bar (Sharp 2004:12).

McGregor (1988:146) says that Oates lists a fourth dialect, Ngawudu, but that this is almost certainly a mishearing of Nawurtu A107. \n\nMcGregor (2004:9) says that owners of the Nangu A105, Najanaja A106 and Nawurtu A107 language varieties regard them as types of Karajarri and use both the general and more specific terms in reference to their language.\n\nPreviously the Thesaurus linked both Karajarri and Kurajarra A85 to the code A64.

Weber notes that, while the differences between these dialects have not been documented, the Mangala dialect described in Hudson (1973) differs phonologically from that described in McKelson (1989).\n\nMcGregor (1988) lists four 'possible dialect names' for Mangala, Djuwali, Jiwali, Koalgurdi and Yalmbau, though no further information is given.

Hudson and Richards (2007 p.c.), who did extensive research on Walmajarri, recognise at least one dialect, namely Juwaliny A88. In their 1990 work, they identified Noonkanbah, which has been influenced by Nyikina K3, as a separate dialect but more recently Hudson and Richards (2007 p.c.) say that if this is a genuine dialect, the people have no name for it.\n\nPililuna A89 is recognised as a dialect of Walmajarri by Dixon (2002) and SCAL (1981). According to Hudson and Richards (2007 p.c.), Pililuna A89 is the name of a station/community and they refer to it as the eastern dialect of Walmajarri, but people from the area just call themselves Walmajarri. Terry (1926:193) says the Boonarra group inhabits the region surrounding Bililuna station, and Capell (1940:423) says that the eastern dialect of Wolmeri (A66), known sometimes as Buna:ra A69, was spoken about Bililuna.\n\nAdditionally, Walsh (1981) lists Nyanyany A90 and Oates (1975) lists Nyardi A91 as dialects of Walmajarri.\n\nKolig (PMS 2255, p.2) says that Wolmadjeri (A66) has developed into a lingua franca in the southern Kimberley area and consequently many different varieties have developed with varying degrees of influence from other languages. He says that Wolmadjeri can be divided into 'light' Wolmadjeri or Djualin A88 spoken 'south of the lower Fitzroy River' (strongly mixed with Mangala A65), 'proper' Wolmadjeri 'south of Fitzroy Crossing, probably as far south as Godfrey's tank (Ganingara)', and 'heavy' or 'half' Wolmadjeri (or Njanjan A90) 'between the southeast of Bohemia Downs and Sturt Creek, with the southernmost point Gregory Salt Lake (Barugu)'.",

In 1991 Kukatja (A68) was spoken by about 1000 people at Wirrumanu (formerly the Balgo Mission) and also at Yaka Yaka, Malarn (Lake Gregory), Billiluna, Kiwirrkura, Lamarnparnta, Ngarantjadu, Ngirrpi, Piparr and Walkarli (Greene, Tramacchi and Gill, 1991:44). In 2011 Kukatja was spoken at Kunawarritji and Balgo (Dixon, 2011:49). Kukatja (A68) and Kukatja C7 are described as separate dialects of the Western Desert language A80. Hansen and Hansen write that the Kukatja (A68) people who settled at Balgo Hills were Pintupi (C10) who travelled north (in the early 20th century, where the Catholic Mission was later established. They were called Kukatja by Walmatjari A66 and others with the translation 'those who use the word \"kuka\" (for meat)' (1975:22). Another group known as Ngalia C2, Mayutjarra and Kukatja C7 were located east of Pintupi country, to the west of Haasts Bluff (Hansen and Hansen, 1975:22). Note that items on Kukatja C7 may be described as being about Kukatja (A68) in MURA.",

Tindale (1974) lists Bunara as an alternative for Ngardi (as well as for Kokatja A68); Cataldi (2007 p.c.) says 'punarra' in Ngardi means 'stripe' or the incision carved into a shield. She allows that it might have been used metaphorically to mean language, though she never heard people using punarra as a language name. However, both Oates and Oates (1970) and Oates (1975) treat Bunara and Ngardi as separate language varieties, and Capell (1940:425, 429) supplies distinct sets of language data for Ngadi A121 and Buna:ra (A69). Further, Capell describes Buna:ra as an eastern dialect of Wolmeri A66; this correspond to Cataldi's Eastern Walmajarri (see A66) (in Honeyman 2005:22), which is apparently closely related - and thus distinct from - Ngardi A121. Given this, Ngardi A121 and Bunara are now treated as distinct language headings in the Thesaurus and a new record has been created for Bunara in AUSTLANG. The code A69 was originally assigned to Bunara; this is reinstated and the new code A121 is assigned to Ngardi.\n",

See record for Wajarri A39 for more information about dialects.\n\nIt is likely that Nhugarn, Nugan and Nokaan (treated separately in this database as W52) are variant spellings of the same name. The location given for Nhugarn (A71) by Marmion (1996) largely matches that described for Nokaan W52 in Tindale (1974). Von Brandenstein (PMS 2124) says that Nugan is an alternative name for Taakurda W15. Though Nhugarn is identified as a dialect of Wajarri A39 in Marmion (1996), Marmion (2007 p.c.) notes that there is little language data available and its identity with respect to Daguda W15 is uncertain.\n\nThe name Wiludjanu, meaning 'western talk', is reported by Tindale (1974) as the Wajarri / Wadjarri A39 name for the language spoken by the Nokaan W52 people.\n\nNhugarn, Nugan and Nokaan are grouped under the same heading (A71) in the Thesaurus.\n\nMarmion (2015 p.c.) suggests that the name Byro Wajarri A113, as listed on the Bundiyarra Aboriginal Community Aboriginal Corporation web site, is probably equivalent to Nhugarn, noting that in more recent times Wajarri varieties have been referred to by station names in the area, such as Byro station and Mileura station, leading to some names existing in parallel with older names.\n\nDocumentation for Daguda W15 and Wajarri A39 may be relevant.",

From a linguistic perspective, though, Sharp recognises only two distinct varieties, Ngurlipartu and Walyirli A73, which she refers to as northern coastal Nyangumarta and southern inland Nyangumarta respectively.\n\nWangka Maya Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre (2012), however, says Ngulipartu is one of four speaker-recognised dialects of Nyiyaparli A50. It is not clear whether this Ngurlipartu is the same as A72, which is generally considered to be a dialect of Nyangumarta A61. The two languages, Nyangumarta and Nyiyaparli, are adjacent, to the north and south respectively. Sharp's (2004:4) informants indicate that (the Nyangumarta-dialect) Ngurlipartu was spoken to the south of Nyangumarta territory (which would place it immediately adjacent to Nyiyaparli). However, two other pieces of information complicate the picture.\n\nThe first is Tonkinson's mention (in Sutton 1995:156) of the 'Iparuka Njangamarda' having, in early historical times, 'usurped the territory of the Ngolibardu tribe around Throssell Range', which is at the northern edge of Nyangumarta country and thus most distant from Nyiyaparli country.\n\nThe second is Wangka Maya PALC's (2012) description of the location of (Nyiyaparli-dialect) Ngulipartu as the second-last in a 'from the top of Nyiyaparli country down' list of dialects. If 'top' means 'north', this would place Ngulipartu towards the southern end of Nyiyaparli territory (and thus far from the northern boundary with Nyangumarta). This must be considered, however, in conjunction with their map which places Palyku (being the name of the people who speak Palykutharri, the last dialect in the 'top-down' list), to the north of Nyiyaparli. This suggests that 'top' may indicate the highest point of elevation rather than the most northerly point. However, there appear to be mountains at both the southern and northern edges of Nyiyaparli country (the boundaries of which are themselves not completely clear).\n\nNote that Tindale (1974) treats Ngolibardu (A72) as a separate group from Njangamarda A61.\n\nDocumentation on Nyangumarta A61 may be relevant.",

Many of the northern Nyangumarta people occupied the Eighty Mile Beach area (Sharp 2004:4) Nyangumarta: Present: northern Pilbara and southern Kimberley areas. The area extends to La Grange (Bidyadanga) and Broome and south-west to Port Hedland Also Marble Bar (Sharp 2004:12) In early historical time the Iparuka Njangamarda usurped the territory of the Ngolibardu tribe around Thros-sell Range. Including this, their territory extends from Rudall River northeast to ['Karbardi] near Swindell Field east of ['Tjandalkuru], (Tindalgoo on maps), thence west to near the eastern border of Warrawagine Station. The Kundal Njangamarda go from this line northwest to ['Man-da] (Munda Well on Munro Station) and west to Anna Plains Station, just south of Cape Missiessy, where ['Jawinja], situated beside the present Station homestead, was their northernmost water. Their southwestern boundary lay along the edge of the tableland north of de Grey and Oakover rivers to ['Jalalo] (Ulalling Hills on maps). (Tindale) According to the map in the biography of Billy Dunn, who is about the only descendant left of the Ngulipartu mob, their territory stretched from just east of the Rabbit Proof Fence (RPF), at a point east of Skull Springs at its most northerly, and east of a line drawn from Roy Hill Statation at its south end near the RPF, east to Lake Dora on the northern side, not as far east as the Ruddal River (where Davis has it), and back towards the west as Davis does show it, in a west-north-west direction to the RPF. It centres on theuplands south of the Throssell Range and I doubt that it goes as far east into the sandhill country as Billy Dunn's map shows (Tonkinson in Sutton 1995:156)\n",

Including this, their territory extends from Rudall River northeast to ['Karbardi] near Swindell Field east of ['Tjandalkuru], (Tindalgoo on maps), thence west to near the eastern border of Warrawagine Station. The Kundal Njangamarda go from this line northwest to ['Man-da] (Munda Well on Munro Station) and west to Anna Plains Station, just south of Cape Missiessy, where ['Jawinja], situated beside the present Station homestead, was their northernmost water.

Therefore, Tindale's Ninanu is listed under Yinhawangka.\n\nJones and Denniss report that, although Yinhawangka has been classified within the Wati subgroup by O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin, the variety of Yinhawangka described in the Wangka Maya 2008 publication is very similar to Banyjima A53 which is part of the Ngayarda subgroup (Wangka Maya PALC 2008:iii). Von Brandenstein (1968:3, PMS 2127) reports an informant as saying that the Ini-war?ga of people living at Onslow was heavily influenced by Pandjima A53.\n\nIt appears that A48 was originally assigned to Ngalawonga, which later became known as Yinhawangka as it was thought to be an alternative (and preferred) name for the same language. An additional code, A79, was created when it became apparent that the two are likely distinct language varieties, but this was applied to Ngalawonga (now Ngarla). The two codes have now been reversed to reflect the original assignment.",

Thieberger says the term Martu Wangka means 'Aboriginal language' and can also 'apply to speakers of a number of languages who call themselves Martu' (Thieberger 1993:194, 202).\n\nTonkinson (1991:12) uses the term Mardu (meaning 'man, people') to refer to the linguistic groups whose home territories lie in the area surrounding Lake Disappointment on the western side of the Gibson Desert, saying these groups are principally the Gardujarra A51, Budijarra A54, Gurajarra A85, Manyjilyjarra A51.1 and Giyajarra A52. Further, Davenport (2005), citing Tonkinson's (1989) work, says that the term Martu is now used to describe people who have appropriate connections to eight dialect-named groups: Manyilyjarra A51.1, Kartujarra A51, Putijarra A54, Warnman A62, Pijakarli (Southern Nyangumarta) A61, Ngulipartu A72, Kurajarra A85 and Kiyajarra A52 and their corresponding territories, which cover much of the Gibson, Little Sandy and Great Sandy deserts in Western Australia.\n\nThe term Martu Wangka thus refers to several dialects of the Western Desert language A80.\n\nMartu Wangka has been confused with Tindale's Maduwongga A6, the location of which is much further south that that described for Martu Wangka. Previously both were assigned to the same code, A6, in the Thesaurus. They now have distinct authorised headings; A6 now relates only to Maduwongga and A86 is used for Martu Wangka. AUSTLANG previously had these codes reversed but this has been corrected to reflect the original assignment of A6 to Maduwongga.\n\nNote that the ABS does not make a distinction between Martu Wangka and Maduwongga so census data may combine information on both of these.

        "language_comment": "There have been varying reports on Nhanhagardi and its identity is unclear. Douglas (1976:3) says Nanakati (A93), referred to by the people of Mullewa, is another dialect of Nju?ar W41, while Tindale (1974) treats it as another name for Widi A13. According to the WA Handbook, Morphy (1985) suggests that Nanakarti (A93) was the language spoken around Carnamah and Gullewa, perhaps to the coast, based on five of Bates' vocabularies. Von Brandenstein (1991) says that the Watjarri A39 word 'Nhanhakarti' means 'this way' and refers to Wirtimaya A13. (See WA Handbook for the details of Bates' vocabularies and also for the details of Morphy (1985) and von Brandenstein (1991).) Nhanhagardi and Naaguja A101 are conflated with Amangu W12 in Blevins (2001) and Oates (1975). Blevins (2001:3) describes the southern dialect of Nhanda W14 as 'Amangu W12 (also known as Amandyo, Nhaaguja (A101?), Njaagurdi and Nyaakurti A93?)'. She locates it 'from Geraldton (Champion Bay) south to Hill River and inland to Mullewa', an area which takes in the area of Nhanhagardi A93 described below by Elefsiniotis (2008 p.c.). Von Brandenstein (1967:2) reports a language which is referred to by his informant as both Njaakurdi and Nanagarri (A93), the same language Gratte (1998:65) worked on which he reports as Nowkadja A101. However, it now appears that Nhanhagardi is a separate variety. According to Vaso Elefsiniotis of Irra Wangga - Geraldton Language Program (2008 p.c.), Nhanhagardi is generally taken as the language and people traditionally of Champion Bay. Further, according to Clarrie Cameron, a descendant of Nhanhagardi (2009 p.c. via Henry Fraser of Irra Wangga - Geraldton Language Programme), Pulinya W43 is an old name for Nhanhagardi. He also comments that Nhanhagardi is a Nhanda S14 language. Further, although Gratte (2007, PMS 5968) reports that the name Ngukaja A101 has now been as the 'tribal name for the Geraldton area', he notes that in earlier times there were in fact four dialects spoken in the region. There is a short recording of a song in Nhanhagardi held by AIATSIS (VON-BRANDENSTEIN_04-002150).\n",

Blevins (2001:5) suspects that Cheangwa is a Nhanda W14 word - 'Jianga' is the name of a place near the Murchison where there is a big thicket and '-waa' is the Nhanda suffix meaning 'with'. O'Grady et al. treat Cheangwa as an alternative name for Widi A13. Thieberger (1993) lists Cheangwa as an alternative name for Wajarri A39. Language data from Perks in Curr (1886) is associated with the name Cheangwa, though the name is used only to describe the location of a 'tribe' and their language, neither of which are named. This location is within the boundaries described for both Widi A13 and Daguda W15. A comparison of the data in Curr with other language data may clarify the identity of 'Cheangwa'. Until more is known, Cheangwa is treated as a distinct language variety.\n",

Pintupi-Luritja combines some of the dialect features of the eastern and western groups and is  influenced by close contact with Western Arrernte C47 and Warlpiri C15 (Heffernan and Heffernan, 1999:2-3).\n\nPintupi lived with Mayutjarra and other language groups at Haasts Bluff and later Papunya in the early 20th century. The term Luritja C10 once referred to the Pintupi and Mayutjarra families who settled in those places in the 1930's. Pintupi referred to people at Papunya who settled there between 1956-1962, and the children of people who moved to Haasts Bluff in this period call themselves Luritja (Hansen and Hansen, 1975:23). The language spoken by them is influenced by Mayutjarra and surrounding languages, and is called the Luritja dialect. Hansen and Hansen report that some people prefer the term Luritja, with connotations of higher social status (1975:23).\n\nTindale (1974) describes 'Ildawongga' located in country generally identified as the Pintupi-speaking. According to Doug Marmion, Ildawonga is likely to be a misunderstanding by Tindale of the common Pintupi phrase 'yilta wangka', meaning 'true/correct speech'.\n\nSee also Kukatja C7.",

There is a possibility that the Eastern dialect was actually a koine formerly used as a lingua franca for speakers of Wakaya (C16), Yinjilanji G14 and Bularnu G12.1. Breen considers the possibility that material recorded by Spencer and Gillen (mostly in 1904:80-81) from a Wakaya man visiting the Warumungu C18 represents a third variety. The small amount of evidence suggests that this variety may have had noun classes (Breen, nd:30-31).\n",

Harvey says Wambaya is extremely endangered (2008:4). The Mirndi language family consists of two geographically non-contiguous groups on the Barkly Tableland in the Northern Territory: Western Mirndi, with two languages 'Jaminjungan' (see Jaminjung N18 and Ngaliwurru N19) and Nungali N28; and Eastern Mirndi, with three languages, Jingulu C22, Ngarnka N121 and the Wambayan language group. The Wambayan language group and Ngarnka (N121) are in turn two languages which form a genetic group that Harvey calls 'Ngurlun' (Harvey, 2008:1-3). Earlier writers call Wambayan the 'McArthur language', after the river which forms part of the territories affiliated with Gudanji, Binbinka and Wambaya (Nordlinger 1998:5 and Chadwick 1989:1-2). Nordlinger's description of these two non-contiguous but related language groups is similar: the first consisting of Jaminjung N18, Naliwuru N19 and Nungali N28 located in the geographic west and the second in the geographic east the 'West Barkly' set consisting of Jingili C22 along with the 'Eastern Group' of Ngarnga N121 and the McArthur language (see above) (1998:4).\n",

The Mirndi languages are spread across two geographically non-contiguous areas: Eastern Mirndi, with Jingulu, Ngarnka N121 and 'Wambayan' (see Binbinka N138, Gudanji C26 and Wambaya C19); and Western Mirndi, with 'Jaminjungan' (see Jaminjung N18, Ngaliwurru N19) and Nungali N28 (Harvey, 2008:1-3). Nordlinger's describes the group located in the geographic west: Jaminjung N18, Naliwuru N19 and Nungali N28 and in the geographic east the 'West Barkly' set consisting of Jingili (C22) and the 'Eastern Group' of Ngarnga N121 and the McArthur language (aka 'Wambayan') (1998:4). This language has been referred to as 'Jingili'. Pensalfini says that Jingili people speak Jingulu (C22) language (1997:17). Harvey says Jingulu is extremely endangered (2008:4).\n",

The Daly Waters area is in Jingulu country (Avery in Sutton 1995:104). \n\nBeginning at the southern end of this 80 km stretch of country, all ten precisely mapped sites west of the Stuart Highway and south of Elliott were identified as Jingili places. As we proceeded north from there, also keeping west of the Stuart Highway, we mapped seven named places along the main Newcastle Waters waterbody, locally known as Longreach Waterhole. North of there, continuing along the western side of the Stuart Highway, nine more places were identified as Jingili, but as we moved north they were increasingly missed with sites of dual Mudburra/Jingili identity, particularly along Newcastle Creek and Bucket Creek (Sutton 1995:106). \n\nEastward limit: Ucharonidge homestead was associated with Jingulu. Eva Downs homestead was associated with Wambaya. the area around Mundah Waterhole and Mungabroom waterhole was the changeover area from Jingulu to Ngarnka. Northward limit: Daly Waters was associated with Jingulu. Maryfield homestead was not associated with Jingulu. Westward limit: The drainages of Newcastle Creek and Daly Waters Creek. Southward limit: Powell Creek was associated with Jingulu. Renner Springs and Mt Grayling were not associated with Jingulu (Harvey ASEDA 802). \n",

Gunindiri (C23), Garrwa N155 and the neighbouring language Waanyi G23 belong to the Garrwan language family, located in the Gulf of Carpentaria and is the 'only family which has explicitly been analysed as having an indeterminate or intermediate status' regarding its classification as non-Pama Nyungan or Pama Nyungan (Harvey, 2009:197-198). Harvey argues 'the evaluation of the overall evidence shows Garrwan to be a PN family, within the terms of the criteria for the hypothesised opposition' (2009:198). In contrast, earlier analyses by Blake (1990) and Evans (2005) classify Garrwan as non-Pama Nyungan (in Mushin, 2012:6).\n",

It may be that Kun(in)dirri occupied a band of country stretching from the headwaters of the Cresswell and Nicholson across to Wollogorang and Westemoreland. My map reflects this uncertainty (Breen 2003:426)\n\nAlong the Robinson and Calvert Rivers, south of the Karrawa (Basedow 1907:3)\n\nThe reasonably certain general associations of Gunindirri were to Wollogorang and Westmoreland. Eastward limits: Just to the east of Westmoreland, there is a change of affiliations to Ganggalida. Southward limits: China Wall - north of China Wall is Gunindirri, south of China Wall is Wanyi. Westward limits: These are uncertain. The Creswell Downs area was associated with either Gunindirri or Wanyi, but there is no direct evidence as to which. Northward limits: There is no definite information on the northward limits to the association of Gunindirri (Harvey ASEDA 802)",

Harvey says Gudanji (C26) is extremely endangered (2008:4). The Mirndi language family consists of two geographically non-contiguous groups on the Barkly Tableland in the Northern Territory: Western Mirndi, with two languages 'Jaminjungan' (see Jaminjung N18 and Ngaliwurru N19) and Nungali N28; and Eastern Mirndi, with three languages, Jingulu C22, Ngarnka N121 and the Wambayan language group. The Wambayan language group and Ngarnka (N121) are in turn two languages which form a genetic group that Harvey calls 'Ngurlun' (Harvey, 2008:1-3). Earlier writers call Wambayan the 'McArthur language', after the river which forms part of the territories affiliated with Gudanji, Binbinka and Wambaya (Nordlinger 1998:5 and Chadwick 1989:1-2). Nordlinger's description of these two non-contiguous but related language groups is similar: the first consisting of Jaminjung N18, Naliwuru N19 and Nungali N28 located in the geographic west and the second in the geographic east the 'West Barkly' set consisting of Jingili C22 along with the 'Eastern Group' of Ngarnga N121 and the McArthur language (see above) (1998:4).\n",

In other words, the /dj/ phoneme is actually /dh/. However, some confusion arises because this is a distinction between palatal and dental, not alveolar /d/. Further research may clarify any distinction between 'Gugada' and 'Gugadja ~ Gugadha' but all forms remain listed under Kokatha (C3) in this database, a form used by the community.\n\nNot to be confused with other Western Desert varieties Kokatja A68 and Kokatja C7.",

Wilkins (in Henderson 2013:12) provides an overview of the Arandic languages with two major sub-groups: Artwe (~Urtwe) composed of Upper Arrernte (Eastern Arrernte, Western Arrernte (C47), Alyawarr C14, Anmatyerr C8.1) and Lower Arrernte (C29) (Lower South Arandic).

A few people came from Dieri L17 country to the south. Others migrated from Parta Tjurritja (the West MacDonnell Ranges) to the north. Quite a large number of Southern Arrarnta or Partaama C46 came to settle at Ntaria too, because their country is adjacent to the south of Western Arrarnta country. Some Luritja C4, C10 people visited, and a few settled down there. A few Pitjantjatjara C6 mingled and stayed. A few Northern Arrarnta and Anmatjirra C8.1 people also settled at Ntaria. (David Roennfeldt, p.c. 19th November 2015).\n\nWilkins provides a comprehensive overview of the Arandic languages. He describes Tyuretye Arrernte as the Hermannsberg dialect and Pertame C46 as a dialect of Western Arrernte (C47) (in Henderson 2013:12).\n\nBreen writes that the name Tyurretye Arrernte is also used for Western Arrernte (C47). It may be that Tyurretye Arrernte is the original Western' Arrernte, and that the distinct dialect now known as Western Arrernte arose from mixing of this dialect (i.e. Tyurretye) with Pertame C46 at Hermannsberg Mission in the early days of European contact (2001:64).\n\nWilkins (in Henderson 2013:12) provides an overview of the Arandic languages with two major sub-groups: Artwe (~Urtwe) composed of Upper Arrernte (Eastern Arrernte, Western Arrernte (C47), Alyawarr C14 and Anmatyerr C8.1) and Lower Arrernte (C29) (Lower South Arandic).

They were called Kukatja by Walmatjari A66 and others with the translation 'those who use the word \"kuka\" (for meat)' (1975:22).\n\nAccording to Marmion (2005 p.c.), Kukatja people (C7) call themselves Luritja C7.1 these days.\n\nAnother group known as Mayutjarra, Ngalia C2 and Kukatja C7 were located east of Pintupi country, to the west of Haasts Bluff (Hansen and Hansen, 1975:22). Tindale wrote that Matuntara (i.e. Hansens' Mayutjarra) is sometimes considered as a southern group of the Kukatja (C7) (1974:231).\n\nNote that items on Kukatja (C7) may be described as being about Kukatja A68 in MURA.\n\nDocumentation for Kukatja (C7) may also be found under Luritja C7.1 and Pintupi C10.",

The difference in world views between Arrernte and western categories of 'language' also come into play.\n\nWilkins (in Henderson 2013:12) provides an overview of the Arandic languages with two major sub-groups: Artwe (~Urtwe) composed of Upper Arrernte: (Eastern Arrernte, Western Arrernte C47, Alyawarr C14, Anmatyerr C8.1) and Lower Arrernte: (Lower South Arandic). \n\nThe name 'Eastern and Central Arrernte language' is used by Broad (2008), Green (1994) and Henderson and Dobson (1994).\n\nWilkins (in Henderson 1994:12) defines Eastern Arrernte as a language with dialects including Northern Arrernte, Mparntwe Arrernte, Ikngerre-ipenhe (Eastern), Antekerrepenhe C12 and Akarre C28.\n\nThe Picture Dictionary (Broad, 2008) identifies some words as being specific to Eastern, Central, Northern, Southern, North Eastern and South Eastern areas of the Eastern and Central Arrernte region. \n\nSee also Pertame C46; Lower Arrernte C29; Ayerrerenge G12; Antekerrepenhe C12 and Akarre C28. The other major subgroup is called Artweye, with one member Kaytetye C13.\n\nPreviously, both AUSTLANG and the Thesaurus did not distinguish all Arandic varieties. Consequently there may be items in the AIATSIS collection indexed with the 'Arrernte language (C8)' heading which may relate more specifically to one of the varieties listed above. This may also apply to Speaker Numbers and Documentation Scores.",

Some people (for example, Ash, Giacon, and Lissarrague 2003) use the term Gamilaraay as the language name for these dialects.\n\nAccording to Austin, Williams and Wurm (1980:169), there is a distinction between Northern Gamilaraay and Gamilaraay Proper. The former is a northern dialect which covers the area between the Barwon and Gwydir Rivers while the latter covers the area from Walgett south as far as Willow Tree on the edge of the Great Dividing Range.\n\nAustin (2008:38) reports that the Gamilaraay (D23) language revival movement has improved the status and use of the language.",

In his later work, Crowley (1997) links the various forms of both names as representations of the same phonological form, distorted by 'inaccuracies in the nineteenth century records' (p. 281). Accordingly, he adopts the one form, Nganyaywana, for both languages, differentiating them with 'north' and 'south'.\n\nCrowley (1997:284) says that a comparison of lexical material suggests the languages share about 65 per cent vocabulary. Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:213) make reference to a Crowley manuscript, 'An introduction to the New England language', which presumably presents the data on which Crowley bases his lexicostatistics. Crowley (1997:284) also says that orthographic variants of the name Nganyaywana have been used to refer to both languages.\n\nWafer and Lissarrague (2008:201-202) select Anaiwan (D24) and Northern Anaiwan D64 as reference names and provide an in-depth discussion of their weighing of the evidence of phonological forms from the various sources.\n\nCrowley (1976:22-23) uses the term Nganjaywana (D24) as a cover term for two 'either closely related dialects ... or sub-tribal units'), Himberrong D69 and Inuwon D70.",

This location corresponds to that of Wiriyaraay given by Austin, Williams and Wurm (1980:169). \n\nHowever, according to Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:216-221), Wirraay-Wirraay (equivalent to Wirriwirri/Wirri-Wirri above) does not refer to the same language as Wiriyaraay, on the basis of location: Barlow (1873:174) places Wirriwirri in 'Balonne country', which is north of the location of Wiriyaraay D28.\n\nWafer and Lissarrague also identify another language, Wirraayaraay D65, possibly equivalent to Wirraiarai and Wiraerai above, which is related to Wiradjuri D10, while they consider Wirraay-Wirraay to be related to Gamilaraay D23. Note that Wafer and Lissarrague also treat Mathew's 'Wirraiari' (1903:270) as Wirraay-Wirraay.\n\nIt is difficult to say which identity the code D28 originally referred to: Wiriyaraay, Wirraay-Wirraay or Wirraayaraay. Capell's (1963) 'D45 Wirajarai', which Oates and Oates (1970) link to 'A.I.A.S. D28', may be variously interpreted as equivalent to: 1) Wirraayaraay D65, by the name he provides (Wirajarai); 2) Wiriyaraay D28, by the location he provides (Gwydir River from Moree to Bingara, north to Warialda and Gilgil Creek); or 3) Wirraay-Wirraay (D66), by the reference he makes to Mathew's Wirraiari (1903:270).\n\nNote that Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:216-221) argue that there is not enough evidence to support the existence of a language variety called Wiriyaraay, while Austin, Williams and Wurm (2008:169) say it is related to Gamilaraay.\n\nTindale's Weraerai, Wiriwiri in Oates and Oates (1970:167) and Wiri-Wiri in Oates (1975:222) may refer to Wiriyaraay, Wirraay-Wirraay D66 or Wirraayaraay D65.",

The only one well attested is also the most remote geographically, Kalkutungu.' (Breen, 2007:180)\nMcDonald and Wurm (1979:2) suspect that Galali D71 was originally from the Bulloo River but some speakers moved to the Wilson River where they adopted features of the Wilson River languages. \nWa?kumara (Ga?ali) associated with the Wilson River D71 is very close to modern Wa?kumara L68 and Bundamara L26 (McDonald and Wurm 1979:1) and can thus be classified as a Karnic language (Bowern 2001:257; Wafer and Lissarrague 2008:287). \nPreviously these two language varieties were conflated under the same code, D30, based on McDonald and Wurm's suspicion that they were originally the same. However, given that this is not established fact and that, synchronically, the two are sufficiently different to be classified as belonging to different language families, they are now distinguished in this database and the Thesaurus. \nWafer and Lissarrague (2008:287) identify the Kalali data in Holmer's (1988) study of Punthamarra L26 as the Bulloo River variety (D30). \n",

Breen (2007:180) classifies Badjidi and Kalali as 'Karna-Mari fringe' languages which are 'a discontinuous group of languages, mostly poorly attested, scattered between Karnic and Mari languages but not showing much connection with either or with one another'.\n\nBudjari / Badjiri, like Galali D30, is not classified in the AIATSIS tentative classification.\n\nTindale's (1974) and Horton's (1996) maps locate this language in Queensland. However, the maps in Breen (1971) and McDonald and Wurm (1979:viii-ix) show Badjiri also extending into New South Wales.\n\nFour word lists in Curr (1887:276-285) are attributed to Budjari / Badjiri in Mura. However, Breen (1981:276-277) says they might be attributable to other languages: the Conn list to Dharawala D45 or Bidjara E37, Looker to Gunggari D37, Playfair to Marrgany D42 or Gunya D43, and Hollingsworth to Gunya D43.",

In this database, Kooma / Gwamu is treated as a potential dialect of Kogai D38 and is thus classified as a Maric language.\n\nSim (1967) briefly mentions two dialects of Guwamu (D33), differentiated by the loss of 'hard consonants', especially 'g' word-initially, in the northern dialect. He says the northern dialect is called 'N?ragir?u' and the southern dialect, 'B?r?bgir?i' (B?r?? Low). On the line in between these two names appears a comment, 'Known as Gugei people'. It is not clear whether this applies only to the northern dialect or to both. Either way, it would seem to correlate with Breen's observation about the identity of Kogai D38.",

Crowley calls it 'Warwick' after the place name in Queensland (see Maps in Crowley 1978:158 and Sharpe 2005:vii). The name Geynyan is an exonym used by Sharpe's Gidhabal E14 collaborators, initially recorded by Gardner 1851-54, 'Gheeannun' and remembered by Gidhabal people in the 1960s (in Sharpe, 2005:2).\n\nOates (1975:212-213) described Keinyan (D36) as belonging to the Giabalic group, along with Giabal D41 and Kambuwal D29 (in Wafer and Lissarrague, 2008:334). \n\nSee also other dialects in the Bundjalung - Yugembeh dialect chain: Birihn E72; Casino language E73; Ngarabal E92; Dinggabal E16.1; Galibal E15; Gidhabal E14; Mananjahli E76; Minyangbal E18; Nerang Creek language E77; Nganduwal E78; Ngarahgwal E79; Nyangbal E75; Wahlubal E16.2; Wehlubal E80; Wiyabal E16; Wudjebal E96.

The names Gunggari and (possibly) Kogai originate in a Wangkumara L25 word for 'east', 'kungkari', while Mandandanyi comes from the word 'manda' meaning 'go', a word found in the Maranoa-Balonne-Nebine area. From the location of Kogai D38 given by Ridley (1875) and Mathews (1904), it appears 'Kogai tribes' might include Guwamu (Kooma) D33.\n\nTindale (1974) uses Kogai D38 as the name of the language spoken by the Mandandanji D44, Kunggari (D37) and Barrungam D40, but Kite and Wurm (2004) treat Barunggam as a dialect of Waga-Waga E28.\n\nIn this database, Kogai D38 is treated as a language name and Mandandanyi D44, Gunggari and Guwamu D33 are treated as potential dialects of Kogai, although as Breen says, these terms could just be alternative names of Kogai. Tindale says that the Mandandanji D44 were amalgamated with the Kunggari (D37) in the early days of white occupation.\n\nNot to be confused with Kungkari L38.",

Blake and Reid (1998:4-5) note that 'there are two tongues that bear the name Wadi-Wadi, one centred around Swan Hill and the other around Piangil'.\n\nThis database equates Wadi Wadi (D4) with Blake, Hercus, Morey and Ryan's (2011) Wadi Wadi (Swan Hill) and, following Clark (2005:17), Dixon's 'non-Piangil' Wadi Wadi. The 'Piangil' Wadi Wadi was previously listed as an alternative name for both Wadi Wadi (D4) and Weki Weki S33. Blake, Hercus, Morey and Ryan (2011) comment, 'There is a possibility that what we call Wati Wati (Piangil) was in fact the language of the Weki Weki people, though this cannot be proven.' Based on this, a separate record for Wadi Wadi (Piangil) D67 has been created.\n\nNot to be confused with Wodi Wodi S58 which is a Yuin language.",

Generally the latter are reported as alternative names for Barunggam, but Black and Walsh (1989) connect Murrumningana with Muringam, keeping Barunggam distinct. \n\nWalsh 1981, Wurm 2004 and the Ethnologue do not mention Murrumningana (or variants) but make a distinction between Muringam and Barunggam.\n\nCurr supplies language data for 'the Murrumningama' group, whose location aligns with that of Barunggam (1887, vol. 3, pp. 220-21). Murrumningama is consequently listed as a variant of Barunggam in the Thesaurus.\n\nKite and Wurm describe Baru?gam (D40) as a Waga-Waga E28 dialect, the others being Wuli-Wuli E89, Djagunda E27, Dala E25, Waga-Waga (which indicates this is used as both a language name and a dialect name), Duu?idjawu E20, Nalbo E90 and Giabal D41 (2004:4).",

The names Gunggari and possibly Kogai originate in a Wangkumara L25 word for 'east', 'kungkari', while Mandandanyi comes from the word 'manda' meaning 'go', a word found in the Maranoa-Balonne-Nebine area. From the location of Kogai D38 given by Ridley (1875) and Mathews (1904), it appears 'Kogai tribes' might include Guwamu (Kooma) D33.\n\nTindale uses Kogai D38 as the name of the language spoken by the Mandandanji, Kunggari D37 and Barrungam D40, but Kite (2004) treats Barunggam as a dialect of Waga-Waga E28.\n\nIn this database, Kogai is treated as a language name and Mandandanyi D44, Gunggari D37 and Guwamu D33 are treated as potential dialects of Kogai, although as Breen says, these terms could just be alternative names of Kogai.\n\nTindale says that the Mandandanji were amalgamated with the Kunggari D37 in the early days of white occupation. Mandandanyi (D44), an alternative spelling of Tindale's spelling of Mandandanji, provides a better guide to the original pronunciation (Breen, p.c. April 2019).",

Breen (1971:13-14) concludes that the name should be retained in the absence of any other information and tentatively suggests that the word list supplied by Ahern in Curr (1886) may be Wadjalang (though he later changes his opinion (Breen 1990:69)).\n\nOates and Oates (1970), relating Breen's remark that informants do not recognise the name Wadjalang, claim that he suggests Marganj D42 may have been spoken in the territory allocated to Wadjalang. The source of this information, however, is not apparent. Breen 1971 flags a possible link between Wadjalang and Bidjara (p. 14), and Breen 1990 notes that the territory occupied by speakers of the 'Blackall, Yangeeberra, Mt Enniskillen' (tentative) dialect falls, in part, within the area Tindale associates with Wadjalang (p. 69).\n\nBreen (1990:68) uses Dharawala (rendering of Tarawalla in Breen's phonemic orthography) in preference to Tindale's Wadjalang as the language name on the basis of the phonotactic implausibility of Wadjalang. Breen takes his data from Powell's 'Tarawalla dialect' word list in Curr (1886) and unpublished Wadjalang wordlists collected by Tindale.\n\nDixon (2002) uses both Wadjalang and Dharawala.\n\nIn the Thesaurus, Dharawala is used as the language name and Wadjalang as the people name.",

PaaRuntyi shares some grammatical features with Kurnu and differs from Southern forms of Paakantyi in tense formation. In vocabulary it is closest to Pantyikali D17. Mrs Hannah Quayle provided Wurm with grammatical information and discussed traditional information with Jeremy Beckett (Hercus, 1993:11).

Hercus's Wembawemba group consists of Wembawemba D1, Per?paper?pa (D5) and Narinari D9.\n\nHercus (1986:3) also says that the Ber?baber?ba (D5) language, called 'Bureba' by Mathews (1902b:172-174), was very similar to Wembawemba D1, citing comments by Wembawemba informants: 'Some people at Moonacullah said ber?ba ... for 'no' and their language was nearly the same, just a few words were different from ours.'",

To the west the boundary fell between the Culgoa and Birrie Rivers, and extended eastwards almost to Collarenebri. Within this it is not possible to define an exact boundary between Yuwaalaraay and Yuwaaliyaay. There is, however, some evidence to suggest that Yuwaaliyaay territory was predominantly to the north of the area, and Yuwaalaraay to the south. in the area bounded by the Barwon and Narran Rivers north of Lightning Ridge (Austin, Williams and Wurm 1980:169).\n\nGoodooga-Narran River area (Ash, Giacon, and Lissarrague 2003:5).\n\nlocated upon a tract of country in southern Queensland, including Bokhara, Birrie, Narran, Ballonne and Moonie Rivers, and extend some distance within the New South Wales frontier (Mathews 1902:137) (Mathews does not seem to make a distinction between Yualeai (Yuwaalayaay) and Yuwaalaraay [D27] thus the area given by Mathews probably includes the area for Yuwaalaraay.)",

Walsh (1981) and Wurm (2004) do not mention Murrumningana (or variants) but make a distinction between Muringam and Barunggam.\nCurr (1887, vol. 3, pp. 220-21) supplies language data for 'the Murrumningama tribe', whose location aligns with that of Barunggam.\n\nBased on the information available, there appears to be no linguistic evidence of Muringam's language status.",

In his later work, Crowley (1997) links the various forms of both names as representations of the same phonological form, distorted by 'inaccuracies in the nineteenth century records' (p. 281). Accordingly, he adopts the one form (the more accurate Nganyaywana) for both languages, differentiating them with 'north' and 'south'.\n\nCrowley (1997:284) says that a comparison of lexical material suggests the languages share about 65 per cent vocabulary. Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:213) make reference to a Crowley manuscript, 'An introduction to the New England language', which presumably presents the data on which Crowley bases his lexicostatistics. Crowley (1997:284) also says that orthographic variants of the name Nganyaywana have been used to refer to both languages.\n\nWafer and Lissarrague (2008:201-202) select Anaiwan D24 and Northern Anaiwan (D64) as reference names and provide an in-depth discussion of their weighing of the evidence of phonological forms from the various sources.",

Oates and Oates describe 'Gwydir River from Moree to Bingara, north to Warialda and Gilgil Creek, NSW' as its location. This location corresponds to that of Wiriyaraay D28 given by Austin, Williams and Wurm (1980:169). However, according to Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:216-221), Wirraay-Wirraay (equivalent to Wirriwirri/Wirri-Wirri above) does not refer to the same language as Wiriyaraay, on the basis of location: Barlow (1873:174) places Wirriwirri in 'Balonne country', which is north of the location of Wiriyaraay D28.\n\nWafer and Lissarrague identify another language, Wirraayaraay D65, possibly equivalent to Wirraiarai and Wiraerai above, which is related to Wiradjuri D10, while they consider Wirraay-Wirraay to be related to Gamilaraay D23. Note that Wafer and Lissarrague also treat Mathew's 'Wirraiari' (1903:270) as Wirraay-Wirraay.\n\nIt is difficult to say which identity the code D28 originally referred to: Wiriyaraay, Wirraay-Wirraay or Wirraayaraay. Capell's (1963) 'D45 Wirajarai', which Oates and Oates (1970) link to 'A.I.A.S. D28', may be variously interpreted as equivalent to: 1) Wirraayaraay D65, by the name he provides (Wirajarai); 2) Wiriyaraay D28, by the location he provides (Gwydir River from Moree to Bingara, north to Warialda and Gilgil Creek); or 3) Wirraay-Wirraay (D66), by the reference he makes to Mathew's Wirraiari (1903:270).\n\nTindale's Weraerai, Wiriwiri in Oates and Oates (1970:167) and Wiri-Wiri in Oates (1975:222) may refer to Wiriyaraay D28, Wirraay-Wirraay or Wirraayaraay D65.",

According to Clark (1990:404), Dixon (Working Papers) has suggested that Wadiwadi D4 was divided into two dialects, 'Piangil' and 'non-Piangil'. (Note, though, that Dixon only lists Wadi-Wadi in his 2002 classification, without any reference to Biangil/Piangil.) Blake and Reid (1998:4-5) note that 'there are two tongues that bear the name Wadi-Wadi, one centred around Swan Hill and the other around Piangil'. \n\nThis database equates Wadi Wadi D4 with Blake, Hercus, Morey and Ryan's (2011) Wadi Wadi (Swan Hill) and, following Clark (2005:17), Dixon's 'non-Piangil' Wadi Wadi. 'Piangil' was previously listed as an alternative name for both Wadi Wadi D4 and Weki Weki S33. Blake, Hercus, Morey and Ryan (2011) comment, 'There is a possibility that what we call Wati Wati (Piangil) was in fact the language of the Weki Weki people, though this cannot be proven.' Based on this, a separate record for Wadi Wadi (Piangil) (D67) has been created, while also noting that the two names may refer to the same language. Given this, documentation on Wadi Wadi and Weki Weki may also be relevant.\n\nNot to be confused with Wodi Wodi S58 which is a Yuin language.",

The only one well attested is also the most remote geographically, Kalkutungu.' (Breen, 2007:180)\nMcDonald and Wurm (1979:2) suspect that Galali D71 was originally from the Bulloo River but some speakers moved to the Wilson River where they adopted features of the Wilson River languages. \nWa?kumara (Ga?ali) associated with the Wilson River D71 is very close to modern Wa?kumara L68 and Bundamara L26 (McDonald and Wurm 1979:1) and can thus be classified as a Karnic language (Bowern 2001:257; Wafer and Lissarrague 2008:287). \nPreviously these two language varieties were conflated under the same code, D30, based on McDonald and Wurm's suspicion that they were originally the same. However, given that this is not established fact and that, synchronically, the two are sufficiently different to be classified as belonging to different language families, they are now distinguished in this database and the Thesaurus. \nWafer and Lissarrague (2008:287) identify the Kalali data in Holmer's (1988) study of Punthamarra L26 as the Bulloo River variety (D30). \n",

Among the classifications included in this database, only Dixon (2002) groups Yugambal together with Bundjalung languages and all others classify Yugambal as a 'Yuin-Kuri' language. \n\nWafer and Lissarrague (2008:332-334) group Yugambal together with Bigambal D34 and Guyambal D35 (non-Bundjalung languages) under the name, 'East Queensland Border' languages although they acknowledge that different researchers have classified these three languages differently.   \n\nTindale lists Yukumbil as an alternative name of Jukambal (E11), but according to Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:335), Yukumbil data collected by Radcliffe-Brown (1929: 401, 413) shows that it is a dialect of Bundjalung not Yugambal.\n\nCrowley (1976, 1997) treats Yugambal, Ngarbal E68 and Marbal E91 as dialects of one language, on the basis of the comment made by MacPherson (1904:683) that speakers of these three varieties understood each other.",

        "language_comment": "The status of Arakwal is unclear. The area identified as Arakwal by Tindale (1974:191) corresponds to the language areas identified as Nganduwal E78, Minyangbal E18, Wiyabal E15.1, Nyangbal E75, Banjalang E12, Galibal E15, Gidabal E14 and Casino E73 by Crowley (1978:144-150). The sources Tindale cites do not mention the name Arakwal; Crowley identifies these sources as referring to the Bundjalung dialects listed above. \n\nTindale lists as alternative names of Arakwal: Kahwul (from Mathews), Coo-al, Jawkum Jore and Kogung (from Hargrave), and Nyung (from Livingstone). It is not clear why Tindale treats them as alternative names of Arakwal. It could be based on the location information (1974:191). \n\nOates (1975:212) deletes Arakawal, commenting that Ngara:ngbal E79 is considered to be the dialect O'Grady et al. (and Oates and Oates 1970) wrongly named Arakawal (E13). Both Capell (1963) and O'Grady, Voegelin and Voeglin (1966) list this name but there appears to be no linguistic data connected to it.\n\nWafer and Lissarrague treat Arakwal as an alternative name of a Bundjalung dialect, which they spell as 'Ngarahgwal' E79 and say, 'We emphasise that the entries below that refer to \"Arakwal\" (etc.) are included only to provide cross-references for the name \"Ngarahgwal\". In some cases the geographical and other data that are associated with these entries (e.g. Tindale 1974:191) do not pertain to the Gold Coast dialects, and are more likely to pertain to Ngahnduwal E79 or Minyangbal' E18 (2008:365).\n\nThus, Arakwal does not seem to refer to a specific or distinctive dialect. Arakwal might have been a sort of cover term for some of the Bundjalung dialects, or it might be the case that Arakwal is another spelling of Ngarahngwal E79. (Sharpe (1985) uses 'Ngarahgwal' and the Ngarakwal Nganduwal Aboriginal Corporation uses 'Ngarakwal'. Both of these are basically the same form as Arakwal except for the word-initial velar nasal 'ng'.) However the location does not match, Ngarahngwal is further north.\n\nToday Arakwal is used as a group name. The Arakwal People of Byron Bay web site mentions the language of the Arakwal people, indicating that Arakwal is a variant name for the language otherwise called Minyanbal E18: 'This country and our language dialect correspond closely to the language group Minyanbal on the Bundjalung tribal language area map given on the web site.  Our language is at times referred to as Arakwal-Minyanbal.' (, viewed 25 February 2015). \n\nCrowley (1978:150) identifies Minjungbal E18 as the language of Byron Bay.",

This database follows that convention and applies the code (E16) to both names. \n\nWiyabal was previously listed under the code (E15.1) and the Languages Thesaurus listed Widjabal / Wiyabal under the code (E16). The Languages Thesaurus previously also listed Nyangbal under the same code (E16), but this is a different language which now has its own code, see E75.

        "location_information": "Beaudesert, Logan and Albert Rivers area (Sharpe 1985).\n\nThe Yugumbir territory was shaped like a right-angled triangle. The eastern boundary with the Ngaraangbal territory was a line running south from near Beenleigh, through Tamborine Mountain to Binna Burra. The southern boundary with Galibal and Gidabal territory was a line running west along the McPherson Range as far as Mount Ballow. The third side of the triangle, the boundary with Yuggera territory, ran north-east from Mount Ballow to near Beenleigh. Yugumbir territory thus contained all of the upper Albert and Logan valleys, with the exception of Teviot Brook (in Yuggera territory) and with the addition of the headwaters of the Coomera River. The boundary between Yugumbir and Yuggera has been a matter of debate. Several authorities have considered that the boundary was along the Logan River; on that view, Beaudesert and Rathdowney lie on the border. The view adopted here, however, follows the opinion of T.W.Hardcastle, who lived near Boonah and gave careful thought to the question without resolving it precisely. He stated \"the natives of the Teviot Valley spoke Yug-gra-bul... The Maroon and Upper Logan aboriginies spoke Yug-um-bir. I could never find their tribal boundaries\" (Steele 1984:68).",

The northern side of Port Stephens and left bank of the Karuah was occupied by the Gamipingal. All four were hordes of the Worimi (Enright 1932a: 75 as cited in Lissarrague 2010:11).\n",

In this database, Yugara, Turubul E86, Guwar E26, Jandai E19, and Yugarabal E66 are treated as closely related languages although they might be better treated as closely related dialects.

He found evidence of borrowing from Yagara E23, which is consistent with long and close contact (2011:117).\n\nOther sources indicate that the Moreton Bay region and the people from that area are known as Quandamooka. This is a regional grouping that consists of Jagara E23 and Koopenul in the Cleveland area, Nunukal E21 and Goenpul (see Jandai E19) people from Stradbroke Island and Ngugi (E26) from Moreton Island.",

(E32), a light dialect probably spoken down-river, probably along the middle Burnett and distinguished from a 'heavy' dialect by the rhotics  (r sounds) which are not as strongly flapped; stress is not as prominent; the vowels are longer; the palatal /dj/ phoneme in initial position is sometimes realised as /d/; and the final nasal of tense inflections is dropped (1975:2A). \n\nGure? Gure? (E32) shares a class system with Wakka E28, with four classes and two moieties, and is a member of the Wakka-Kabic group of languages. Although these languages have some lexical differences they are phonologically, morphologically and syntactically similar (Brasch, 1975:2A-3A).\n\nHolmer indicates that the languages of the Wakka Group are divisible into two subgroups; a western group including Wakka-Wakka E28, Barungggam D40 and Wuli-Wuli E89 and an eastern group including Goreng-Goreng (E32), Goeng-Goeng E36, Kabi-Kabi E29 and Batjala E30. Goreng-Goreng and Goeng-Goeng are closely related (Holmer, 1983:1).\n\nBrasch disagrees with aspects of this classification, she indicates that Gure? Gure? is syntactically and phonologically similar to Wakka Wakka. Major languages of the Wakka-Kabic Group include Kabi E29, Goinbal, Du?idjaw E20, Yagara E23, Badjala E30 and Gure? (E32) (1975:5E).\n\nBreen describes Daribalang E33 and Guweng-Guweng E36 as a dialects of Gureng-Gureng (E32) (2009:247).",

He also alludes to there being two minimally different dialects of Bidjara / Bidyara: a southern group who 'regard their tribal territory as comprising approximately the country drained by the upper Warrego (above Charleville) and usually call their language the 'Warrego Language'', and a northern (Clermont) group who 'call themselves Bidyara and speak the same dialect (with isolated differences in vocabulary) but are generally referred to by the southern speakers as Wadyaningu or Wadyaninga. It is not known whether this is a name used by the Bidyara on the inland side of the Great Divide for those on the seaward side, or whether it was a Bidyara name for a language to the north and is mistakenly applied to the Clermont people.'\n\nDue to the uncertain status of these names, as well as the low chance of materials emerging which are specifically about one dialect or the other, the Bidjara dialects are not included in this database, nor in the Thesaurus.",

Baranha is a Biri E57 dialect  An alternative name Parnabal is the name of a place at some distance to the south from country associated with Baranha (Breen, 2009:229).\n\nA word list in Curr (1887), 'Fort Cooper: Aminungo tribe' (no. 145) is described by Oates and Oates as 'possibly' referring to Barna (E53)  (1970:173).  Breen describes the Fort Cooper wordlist as Wirri E57, another Biri E56 dialect (2009:227).\n\nOther dialects of the Biri language include Biri E56, Yangga E52, Yilba E55, Miyan E50, Wirri E57, Gabulbarra E45, Baradha E48, Yambina E51, Yetimarala E63, Garaynbal E38, Gangulu E40 and the Brown River language (Breen, 2009).",

Breen says that the spelling of this dialect is in some doubt, it may be that Wiri and Biri E56 are a pair involving initial lenition of /b/ to /w/. Breen spells it Wirri on the basis that Chesney, who recorded a speaker in 1966, wrote Widi, indicating a tap (2009:228), although the name was not included in the recording.\n\nOther dialects of the Biri language include Biri E56, Yangga E52, Yilba E55, Miyan E50, Gabulbarra E45, Baradha E48, Baranha E53, Yambina E51, Yetimarala E63, Garaynbal E38, Gangulu E40 and the Brown River language (Breen, 2009).",

Note that Hardcastle treats his Yuggarabul (E66*) as a dialect of Watson's Yugarabul, observing that Yuggarabul has a short 'u' sound where Yugarabul has a short 'a' sound.

Tindale treats Worimi E2 as a group name whose language is Kattang (E67) (1974:201-2). Holmer describes Kattang (E67) and Thangatti E6 as closely related and quotes language collaborators who consider them  dialects of one language, and that 'Kattang country extended ... from Telegraph Point ... to Hawkesbury River, almost as far as Sydney' (1966:1-2).\n\nWafer and Lissarrague (2008:168-169) and also Lissarrague (2010:9-11) provide a summary of different usage of the term Gadhang (E67). Wafer and Lissarrague treat Gadhang (Taree dialect) (E67), Warrimay E2, Guringay (Gringai) E95, and Birrbay E3 as dialects of one language, which they call 'Lower North Coast Language' (2008:167-168). \n\nLissarrague uses the word 'Gathang' (E67) as the name of the language spoken by Birrbay E3, Guringay E95 and Warrimay E2 peoples (2010:1), a practice also used by the online dictionary: http://www.firstvoices.com/fr/GathangGathang: 'We, the Birrbay, Guringay and Warrimay people are connecting with our language, our culture and and our history in reclaiming Gathang, the language of our Ancestors' .\n\nArposio (2008:10) describes Awabakal as a dialect within a larger language group including Gadhang / Kattang E67 to the north and extending southwards from Newcastle down the coast to the northern shores of Botany Bay, reflecting Fraser's (1892) 'Kuringgai' group.\n\nWafer and Lissarrague (2008, 2010) disambiguate the different uses of the term 'Kuringgai', the same as Ku-ring-gai, the north Sydney place name, and similar to Guringay E95. They also address the confusion over the relationship between the 'Hunter River  -  Lake Macquarie language' (Awabakal S66, Wanarruwa S63, Kuringgai S62 and  Kayawaykal E1) and the 'Lower North Coast language' (i.e. Gathang, Birrpay E3, Warrimay E2 and Guringay E95) indicating these are two distinct languages. Dhanggati is described as a separate language (Wafer and Lissarrague, 2008:194).",

        "language_comment": "Sources vary in their descriptions of Gumbaynggirr dialects. According to Mathews (in Smythe, 1948:4) there are no dialects, but Smythe insists that there are at least two, a northern and a southern, evidenced by both a comparison of data and speakers' perceptions. Eades (1979:246) details the four dialects reported across the sources, noting that there is little supporting evidence for them: a northern dialect (Smythe); Ba:nbay E8 in the west (Mathews); Gambalamam E85 on the Dorrigo Plateau (Crowley) and Southern Gumbaynggir (on which Eades' work is based). Morelli's work (Muurbay, 2001) is based on the southern dialect spoken from the Bellinger River to the Nambucca River and relies on the earlier work of Eades (1979). Morelli (Muurrbay 2001:8) indicates there were several dialects of Gumbaynggirr between Nambucca in the south to the Mid-Clarence region in the north, travelling west as far as Guyra on the Tablelands the region of the Baanbay E8 dialect. Nymboidian E98 (related to Baanbay) and the Northern Coastal Gumbaynggir dialects including Magan.girr and the Grafton dialect were also recorded by Laves, along with the Wolgoolga-Nana Glen dialect, with mention of an Orara dialect. Gambalaman E85 was spoken in the Dorrigo region. The place name Guyra is a corruption of gayaar 'white cockatoo'; Dundurrabin is the Gumbayngirr word dandarrbiin 'many stringy barks', which in turn is the basis for Dorrigo, dandarrga 'string bark tree'. Morelli later describes one language with three mutually intelligible dialects which survived white incursions. He describes them as 'Northern Lowlands to be found, for example, at Grafton; Southern (E7), bordered by the Nambucca River; and Nymboidan E98, which graded into the Baanbay E8 of the New England Tablelands that reached to around Guyra and Tingha' (2008:ix). Wafer and Lissarrague interpreting Morelli's 2001 discussion of Gumbaynggirr dialects (Muurrbay 2001), propose five primary dialects: Northern, Middle and Southern, with a Coastal/Inland division for Northern and Middle regions. They later detail further dialects, based on the Muurrbay (2001:7) map, noting the uncertain identity of these with respect to their primary five dialects: Jambiny, Garrigalgay, Dawaalam, Mirragalgi, Yuraarla, Marraambilambari, Gurubida and Budaabang/Budaabangbari (2008:357-8). Given the uncertainty around the number and identity of Gumbaynggirr dialects, only the more commonly reported names are included in the Thesaurus: Baanbay E8, Nymboidan E98 and Gambalamam E85.",

Sharpe described this variety as Beaudesert Yugambeh (Mananjahli) (E76), along with Yugambeh E17 (1995 in Wafer and Lissarrague, 2008:354). Sharpe notes that Manaldjali (E76) is 'claimed to mean \"hard, baked ground\" a reflection of the dryness of the area ...'

Linguists recognise three distinct dialects in this region, designated by Wafer and Lissarrague as Upper Gold Coast (Pimpana language) and Central and Lower Gold Coast (Southport and Burleigh Heads dialects). However, it has not been possible to confirm which variety is also known as Ngarahngwal, or even if Ngarahngwal and Ngarahangbal refer to the same or different dialects (2008:354).\n\nSharpe indicates the name is derived from 'those who say ngarah \"what\" ' (2001:7).\n\nIn 1964 Geytenbeek recorded three songs from the late Charlotte Williams Snr and her son Stan Williams at Woodenbong NSW, in Ngaraangbal (E79), which he also wrote as 'Ngarahngbal' and 'Ngara:kwal' (MS 183). These songs are re-presented in Gumnow (MS 1965). The CREAMER_H02 collection (Archive no. 005041) in the AIATSIS audio-visual archive contains a recording of some place names. \n\nOates (1975:212) says that Ngara:ngbal (E79) is considered the dialect O'Grady (and Oates and Oates) wrongly named Arakawal E13, deleting Arakawal. However, the locations of Ngara:ngbal and Arakawal are different.\n\nSee also: Bundjalung E12; Birihn E72; Casino language E73; Ngarabal E92; Dinggabal E16.1; Galibal E15; Geynyan D36; Gidhabal E14; Mananjahli E76; Minyangbal E18; Nerang Creek language E77; Nganduwal E78; Ngarahgwal E79; Nyangbal E75; Wahlubal E16.2; Wehlubal E80; Wiyabal E16; Wudjebal E96 and Yugambeh E17.

He notes a variant name for Yunggaya: Yuungway or Yuungguway (E9) (2012:1, 99).\n\nBirihn E72 is generally considered a dialect of Bundjalung E12 (e.g. Crowley 1978 and Sharpe 2005).

Lissarrague (2010:12) includes the 'Vocabulary of the Allyn River Black' (Anonymous 1845) among her sources.

Breen (1988:1) says Indjilandji G52 is an alternative spelling for Indjiladji G52.\n\nOates (1975) uses the spelling associated with G52, Indjiladji. She notes that most of Breen's informants regard the language as being identical to Wagaya C16 and located it north and west of Henderson's 'Injeelanjee' G52 location, but that Breen more recently equates Indjiladji with Bularnu G12.1. This is a reference to Breen 1971 in which he identifies the data in Henderson as 'identical to modern Bulanu, and from approximately the same area' (p. 17). (Note that Brammall (1991:2) says Indjilandji G14 forms a bridge between Bularnu and Wakaya.)\n\nOsborne (PMS 1356:1) says Indjilandji G14 was located between Lawn Hill Creek and Gregory River in tribal times and that it is related to Wanji G23 (though not closely). A quick comparison of Osborne's data with Henderson's indicates that they are clearly different languages. Osborne's Indjilandji informant is the same source as Breen's in his earlier recordings (1972, 1976-7).\n\nPreviously only Indjilandji (G14) was included as a language heading in the Thesaurus. As the identity of the name Indjilandji is often unclear, there may be items catalogued as relating to Indjilandji (G14) which actually relate to Indjiladji G52.",

Lardil (Mornington Island) is further removed,having a historical relationship with Proto-Tangkic (1995:9, 12).\n\nNguburindi (G19) is known only through a word list by Roth (1897), which shares 90 per cent vocabulary with modern Yukulta (Evans, 1995:11). Breen also concludes that Ngubirindi G19 is a dialect of the same language as Yukulta (G34), based on his comparison of data (PMS 221).\n\nThe Tangkic languages have genetic affiliation with the non-Pama Nyungan languages of Arnhem Land, but long term contact with Pama Nyungan languages led to morphological and lexical borrowing, and a 'typological convergence ... away from the non-Pama-Nyungan headmarking, prefixing type to a fairly typical Pama-Nyungan type ... (Evans, 1995: 30, 38).\n\nBlake defines the Tangkic group (Yukulta (G34) Lardil, G38, Kayardild G35) as non-Pama-Nyungan languages, based on the pronoun forms.  (1988:39).",

Uloalinya (and variants) appears in early records such as Roth (1897, 1978), Field (1898), Mathews (1899) and Rivet (1925), whereas Lanima appears in the research of Blake and Breen (i.e. Blake and Breen 1971; Breen 1970, 1971, 1972; Blake 1967, 1975, 1976).\n\nWurm (1972, 1994) and Walsh (1981) conflate the two, treating Ulaolinya as a variant form of Lanima, and Blake and Breen (1971:5) say they are 'probably' the same. Tindale (1974) and Dixon (2002), however, treat them as distinct. Tindale gives different locations for Julaolinja G2 (at 'Carlo Springs on upper Mulligan River') and, further south, Lanima (at 'Mulligan River north of Kaliduwarry waterhole').\n\nNote that Oates and Oates (1970) remark that Ulaolinya may be the same as Pitta Pitta G6, adding a further element of uncertainty to the identity of Ulaolinya.\n\nTindale lists Wanggamanha G1 as an alternative name for Lanima, noting that it is the name of the language of the Lanima people. This accords with Blake and Breen (1971) (among others, e.g. Oates (1975) and Dixon (2002)), however Blake (1975) uses Lanima in contrast to Wangkumana G1.\n\nNote also that Capell (1963), who gives the same location as Tindale for Ulaolinja G2, locates Wangawan (equivalent to Wanggamanha according to Blake and Breen (1971)) 'near Lake Amaroo', which is in the region of the upper Mulligan River, not the lower Mulligan River where Lanima is located by Tindale. (Capell has no entry for Lanima.)\n\nFor these reasons, Ulaolinya, Lanima and Wangkamanha are cautiously treated separately in both AUSTLANG and the Thesaurus.",

Breen indicates that relationships with other languages are not clear, but 'correspondences with the West Barkly languages especially are worth further study' (2003:456).\n\nThe Garrwan language family is located in the Gulf of Carpentaria and is the 'only family which has explicitly been analysed as having an indeterminate or intermediate status' regarding its classification as non-Pama Nyungan or Pama Nyungan (Harvey, 2009:197-198). Harvey argues 'the evaluation of the overall evidence shows Garrwan to be a PN family, within the terms of the criteria for the hypothesised opposition' (2009:198).

Languages from the North Wellesley Islands and adjoining mainland include Yukulta (G34), Kayardild G35, Lardil G38 and Yangkaal G37 which O'Grady et al (1966) classify in the 'Tangkic' group (tangka means 'person' in all four languages). Evans classifies Kayardild G35 and Yangkaal G37 as dialects of one language (South Wellesley), while Yukulta (G34) and Nguburindi G19 are dialects of a separate, but closely related language (Mainland). Lardil (Mornington Island) is further removed, having a historical relationship with Proto-Tangkic (1995:9, 12). Breen also concludes that Ngubirindi G19 is a dialect of the same language as Yukulta (G34), based on his comparison of data (PMS 221). The Tangkic languages have genetic affiliation with the non-Pama Nyungan languages of Arnhem Land, but long term contact with Pama Nyungan languages led to morphological and lexical borrowing, and a 'typological convergence ... away from the non-Pama-Nyungan headmarking, prefixing type to a fairly typical Pama-Nyungan type ... (Evans, 1995: 30, 38). Blake defines the Tangkic group (Yukulta (G34) Lardil, G38, Kayardild G35) as non-Pama-Nyungan languages, based on the pronoun forms (1988:39). nb Ganggalidda G30 is a duplicated entry of (G34).",

For the eastern boundary, some say that it went to the western banks of the Albert River and others say that it did not cross the Nicholson river (Keen 1972). from about Westmoreland, east along the coast to Burketown (Osborne PMS 1358). The general associations extended on the coast from Massacre Inlet to just west of Gin Arm Creek. From the coast, they extended inland to the boundary with the Nicholson drainage. Eastward limits: Gin Arm Creek and lower Lily Creek were associated with Minkin. Westward limits: Westmoreland homestead was associated with Gunindirri. Just to the east of this, associations changed to Ganggalida. Hell's Gate was associated with Ganggalida (Harvey ASEDA 802).

Tindale lists Nemarang as an alternate name for Janggal (G37), describing it as a modern name partly of European origin (1974:170).\n\nThe association between Yangkaal language and Gananggalinda people is uncertain. The name Gananggalinda (G37) is used for people from the Dumaji region on the coast. Doomadgee, an Aboriginal community in the Gulf country, is 100 km west of Burketown. It was named after Dumaji, a sandy coastal mound in the land held by the Gananggalinda people . Part of the location provided by Harvey for Yangkaal ('The immediate coast between Bayley Point and Point Parker', see Location) roughly coincides with the area marked Gananggalinda on the AIATSIS Map (Horton, 1994). However Evans (above) describes Yangkaal as a language from South Wellesley.",

Lardil (Mornington Island) is further removed,having a historical relationship with Proto-Tangkic (1995:9, 12). \n\nLardil (G38) incorporates a special speech variety called Demiin (G38) for use in particular occasions. Demiin (or: Damin) utilises a particular phonological range, and consist of a hundred or so word stems which exhibit highly abstract semantics to express the complex range of concepts spoken about in Lardil (Hale and Nash, 1997:247-8).\n\nThe Tangkic languages have genetic affiliation with the non-Pama Nyungan languages of Arnhem Land, but long term contact with Pama Nyungan languages led to morphological and lexical borrowing, and a 'typological convergence ... away from the non-Pama-Nyungan headmarking, prefixing type to a fairly typical Pama-Nyungan type ... (Evans, 1995: 30, 38).\n\nBlake defines the Tangkic group (Yukulta (G34) Lardil, G38, Kayardild G35) as non-Pama-Nyungan languages, based on the pronoun forms (1988:39).

Holmer's informant thinks that his language belongs to Cloncurry or the Flinders and Saxby rivers area. This is broadly the area associated with the Mayi languages.\n\nWhile Holmer uses Bundjil to refer to a specific language, it is likely that the data actually belong to one of the Mayi, or Bundjil, languages, rather than being a distinct variety. Note that Sutton (MS 379, p. 16) lists, among his list of 'Mayabic dialects', a name (presumably of an informant) which is the same as that of Holmer's Bundjil informant.\n\nGiven that this is a language group name, not a language name, it is not included as a language heading in the Thesaurus.",

He considers Tharlimanha and Wangga-Manha G1 to be alternative names of Lhanima.\n\nThe Queensland Indigenous Languages Advisory Committee also treats Rangwa as one of three 'child languages' of Wangka Yutjuru G5, but gives the other dialects as Wangkamanha G1 and Ulaolinya/Lanima, treating Ulaolinya G2 and Lanima G53 as the same identity, distinct from Wangkamanha.",

        "language_comment": "According to Breen (2007 p.c.), Lanima and Yurlayurlanya (Ulaolinya) G2 are groups whose dialect is Wangkamanha G1 (or possibly two names for the same group).\n\nPreviously Lanima was treated as equivalent to Ulaolinya in both AUSTLANG. Uloalinya (and variants) appears in early records such as Roth (1897, 1978), Field (1898), Mathews (1899) and Rivet (1925), whereas Lanima appears in the research of Blake and Breen (i.e. Blake and Breen 1971; Breen 1970, 1971, 1972; Blake 1967, 1975, 1976).\n\nWurm (1972, 1994) and Walsh (1981) conflate the two, treating Ulaolinya as a variant form of Lanima, and Blake and Breen (1971:5) say they are 'probably' the same. Tindale (1974) and Dixon (2002), however, treat them as distinct. Tindale gives different locations for Julaolinja G2 (at 'Carlo Springs on upper Mulligan River') and, further south, Lanima (at 'Mulligan River north of Kaliduwarry waterhole').\n\nNote that Oates and Oates (1970) remark that Ulaolinya may be the same as Pitta Pitta G6, adding a further element of uncertainty to the identity of Ulaolinya.\n\nTindale lists Wanggamanha G1 as an alternative name for Lanima, noting that it is the name of the language of the Lanima people. This accords with Blake and Breen (1971) (among others, e.g. Oates (1975) and Dixon (2002)), however Blake (1975) uses Lanima in contrast to Wangkumana G1.\n\nNote also that Capell (1963), who gives the same location as Tindale for Ulaolinja G2, locates Wangawan (equivalent to Wanggamanha according to Blake and Breen (1971)) 'near Lake Amaroo', which is in the region of the upper Mulligan River, not the lower Mulligan River where Lanima is located by Tindale. (Capell has no entry for Lanima.)\n\nFor these reasons, Lanima, Ulaolinya and Wangkamanha are cautiously treated separately in AUSTLANG.",

Although information is sketchy and McGregor (1988) lists Andidja as an alternative name for Andajin, Saunders (2007 p.c.) believes the two names do not refer to the same language. \n\nAndajin K64, which appears more recently in the records, is treated as closely related to Ngarinyin K18 by Dixon 2002, McGregor and Rumsey 2009 and McGregor 1988 (among others), and is generally associated with the King Leopold Ranges area of WA. According to Saunders (2007 p.c.), Andajin is in a dialectal relationship with Ngarinyin K18 and Wurla K43. Ngarinyin is described as 'heavy' and Wurla and Andajin are described as 'light'.\n\nAndedja appears in the earlier sources (e.g. Elkin 1933, Kabery 1935) and is associated with the Forrest River region. Glasgow, Hocking and Steiner (PMS 656) say that Andidja (K23) has been variously linked to Wumbulgari K32? and Gunin K36, Wunambal K22, and Wuladja K43?. Capell (1963) says it is a dialect of the 'Forrest River' language, along with Gwini K36, Walar K45, Jeidji K32, Manungu K46 and Wembria K31, and Oates (1975) links Andidja / Andidjara (K23) to Wunambal K22.\n\nTindale (1974) does not mention 'Andajin' but associates Andedja / Andidja with two different identities, as a variant name for both Wilawila K35 and Ngarinjin K18.\n\nSaunders (p.c.) says both Andajin and Andidja have been referred to as Arawari K28, which is a directional term meaning 'south' or 'south-east'.\n\nAs K23 was originally assigned to Andidja, this code assignment has been restored and a new record and code for Andajin K64 has been created.",

McGregor edited and republished their work in 2006 and, though he does not include Bemba in his 2004 publication, he makes several comments that confirm the status of Bemba as a language, including it in his list of 'modern spellings' of 'languages mentioned in this book' (McGregor 2006:xix). He also comments, 'some languages Nekes and Worms investigated do show genders or noun classes...These include northern Kimberley languages Bemba and Ngarinyin.' (McGregor 2006:362, n.87).",

He further says that Arawarri (K28) has been used as an alternative name for Andajin K23 as well as another, distinct language variety (possibly Andedja K23) associated with country near Wyndham, noting that this is hundreds of kilometres to the north-east of Andajin and therefore unlikely to refer to the same identity.\n\nTindale lists Arawari / Arawodi (K28), along with Woljamidi (K26), as an alternative name for Arnga (K37), but Elkin (1933), Davidson (1938) and Greenway (1960) distinguish these.\n\nThe languages of the Forrest River area appear to be very closely related. Jones (2006) equates Arruwarri (K28), Gunin K36, Yeiji K32, Wunambal K22 and 'Bamberre', stating that they are simply different names for the same language, which she calls the Forrest River Language.",

        "location_information": "Small Nyigina, spoken around Mount Anderson and Liveringa, and Big Nyigina, which used to be widely spoken at Noonkanbah (Stokes 1984:3).\n\nThe general associations were to the drainage of the Fitzroy from just upstream of Noonkanbah. Eastward limit: Nyikina owners in 2007 did not claim territory upstream of Noonkanbah. Nobody had definite information on the affiliation of the area between Noonkanbah and Fitzroy Crossing in 2007. In the 1960s, Walmajarri owners reported Nyardi as the land-language affiliation in this area. Tindale's ascription of Wanji or Tjaba also appears to apply to this area. Northward limit: The Oscar Range and the divide between the Fitzroy and the Meda. Derby is more plausibly associated with Warrwa rather than Nyikina. Westward limit: Nyikina speakers reported Logue River as Nyikina. Nyikina speakers reported Nilli Bubbuca Well and Bulleura OC as the northernmost points of Nyikina country. Nyikina speakers reported Mt Clarkson as Nimanburru. Therefore sources in 2007 and older sources agree that the southern boundary of Nimanburru with Nyikina lay along the drainage divide between the Fraser River drainage  -  Nimanburru, and the Logue River drainage  -  Nyikina. This is contrary to Tindale who records the Logue River and Yeeda as Warrwa. Dampier Downs homestead was Nyikina. Southward limit: Geegully Creek and the Edgar Range were associated with Nyikina. Nerrima Creek is also associated with Nyikina (Harvey ASEDA 802).",

Tindale (1974:153) also reports that 'the Jeidji K32 people living near the Forrest River Mission, sometimes called Gwini, have also been termed Miwa K44'. Capell (1972:157) found no 'native term' for the various dialects of the Forrest River area, but noted that Gwini had sometimes been used.\n\nThe languages of this area appear to be very closely related. Jones (2006) equates Gunin, Yeiji K32, Wunambal K22, Arruwarri K28 and 'Bamberre', stating that they are simply different names for the same language, which she calls the Forrest River Language.\n\nToday Gunin/Kwini is regarded as a language variety associated with the Kalumburu area and east of there.\n\nThe term Pela has been used by some in reference to a language which could be Gunin, though Capell and Coate (1984:4) say Pela is neither a tribal nor a language name, but possibly the name of a region. Hernandez (1941:212) on other hand lists it among the tribal and language names of the Drysdale River area. Due to the variation in use and the resulting ambiguity, items in the AIATSIS catalogue that mention Pela are catalogued with both Miwa and Gunin language headings.",

        "location_information": "Coasts of Admiralty Gulf except in the vicinity of Osborne Islands; east to Monger Creek in Napier Broome Bay; south only to southern rim of valley of King Edward River; a horde on Sir Graham Moore Island, whose people were chiefly marine food gatherers (Tindale 1974).(On McGregor's map 1983, it extends further to East.)\n\nThe general association was to the coast from the Osborne Islands to Poempangala Hill, and attendant drainages into this section of coast. In his description of Wunambal, Tindale states 'the Tjawurungari (Tawandjangango) were on the Osborne Islands. The last-named were also called Wilawila people and their language is thought to have affinities with Kambure. According to a native informant they are 'light Kambure' speakers. Another tribe claiming the name Wilawila lives on the Carson River (see separate heading)'. The motivation for Tindale excluding the Osborne Islands from the Gaambera area is obscure, especially as his informant described them as speaking Gaambera. In 2007, nobody recognized the name Wila-Wila as applying to the Carson River area. However, two separate sources recognized the name as applying focally to an insular Wunambalic variety. One source specifically associated the name to Bigge Island and the adjacent coastal Hunter River area. This is within Wunambal country.Tom Vigilante stated that his understanding was that the area was Gaambera. Vigilante also stated that the drainage of Monger Creek was Gaambera, with the eastern boundary being in the Poempangala hill range. Anthony Redmond stated that the name Gaambera did not extend into the King Edward River drainage (Harvey ASEDA 802)\n\nWunambal Gaambera Country lies in the north west Kimberley area of Western Australia. It incorporates some 200 kilometers of coastal and inland country, from Prince Frederick Harbour in the south west to Napier Broome Bay in the northeast, including parts of the King Edward River, the Anjo and Bougainville Peninsulas, the Mitchell and Gardner Plateaus, the Mitchell and lower Roe Rivers, the Bonaparte Archipelago and the Admiralty Gulf Aboriginal Reserve. It also includes large areas of intensely dissected coastal country, the seas of the Bonaparte Archipelago and Admiralty Gulf with many islands, the largest being Bigge Island, estuaries bays and harbours' (Karadada et al. 2011:10)\n\nContemporary location\nWunambal Gaambera people mainly live in the communities of Kalumburu, Kandiwal and Mowanjum near Derby, with some speakers also living in Kununurra and Wyndham, as well as a few outstations and camps in the dry season.

Tindale (1974:153) also reports that 'the Jeidji K32 people living near the Forrest River Mission, sometimes called Gwini K36, have also been termed Miwa K44'.\n\nThe languages of the northern Kimberley area appear to be very closely related. Jones (2006) equates Gunin K36, Yeiji K32, Wunambal K22, Arruwarri K28 and Bamberr K39?, claiming that they are simply different names for the same language, which she calls the Forrest River Language.\n\nThe term Pela has also been used by some in reference to a language which could be Miwa or Gunin K36. McGregor and Rumsey (2009:1) treat Pela as an alternative name of Miwa. Capell and Coate (1984:4) say Pela is neither a tribal nor a language name, but possibly the name of a region. Hernandez (1941:212) on other hand lists it among the tribal and language names of the Drysdale River area.\n\nDue to the variation in use and the resulting ambiguity, items in the AIATSIS catalogue that mention Pela are catalogued with both Miwa and Gunin language headings.",

This territory abuts on the Great Sandy Desert in the south, and extends into the King Leopold Ranges in the north. (McGregor 1994:4).\n\nWest to Fitzroy Crossing; at Bohemia Downs and Margaret River Stations. Formerly south to Christmas Creek, but they lost the open plains on the north side of the river to Walmadjari just before the time of the first appearance of whites. East to junction of Mary and Margaret rivers and the Ramsay Range, north to Stony River, Sandstone, Mueller, Burramundy, and Geikie Ranges; their headquarters were in the eastern limestone areas of the King Leopold Ranges (Tindale 1974).\n\nThe general associations were from Gogo homestead in the west to Margaret River homestead in the east, from the drainage of Christmas Creek in the south to the southernmost King Leopold Ranges in the north. Sources in 2007 stated that Margaret River homestead was not associated with Gija, nor does it appear to have been associated with Djaru. Aboriginal people in the 1960s associated the homestead with Gooniyandi (Harvey ASEDA 802).",

        "language_comment": "Previously Andajin was linked to the code K23 and Andidja was treated as an alternative name. Although information is sketchy and McGregor (1988) lists Andidja as an alternative name for Andajin, Saunders (2007 p.c.) believes the two names do not refer to the same language. \n\nAndajin, which appears more recently in the records, is treated as closely related to Ngarinyin K18 by Dixon (2002), McGregor and Rumsey (2009) and McGregor (1988) and is generally associated with the King Leopold Ranges area of Western Australia. According to Saunders (2007 p.c.), Andajin is in a dialectal relationship with Ngarinyin K18 and Wurla K43. Ngarinyin is described as 'heavy' and Wurla and Andajin are described as 'light'.\n\nAndedja K23 appears in the earlier sources (e.g. Elkin 1933, Kabery 1935) and is associated with the Forrest River region. Glasgow, Hocking and Steiner (nd) say that Andidja K23 has been variously linked to Wumbulgari,  Gunin K36, Wunambal K22, and Wuladja.\n\n Capell (1963) says it is a dialect of the 'Forrest River' language, along with Gwini K36, Walar K45, Jeidji K32, Manungu K46 and Wembria K31, and Oates (1975) links Andidja / Andidjara K23 to Wunambal K22.\n\nTindale (1974) does not mention 'Andajin' but associates Andedja / Andidja with two different identities, as a variant name for both Wilawila K35 and Ngarinjin K18.\n\nSaunders (p.c.) says both Andajin and Andidja have been referred to as Arawari K28, which is a directional term meaning 'south' or 'south-east'.\n\nAs K23 was originally assigned to Andidja, this code assignment has been restored and a new record and code for Andajin K64 has been created.",

This was also the view of another source (Bowern p.c. in Harvey ASEDA 802).\n\nThere is no detailed information on the territorial associations of Jabirr-Jabirr. Tindale describes Jabirr-Jabirr as almost extinct in 1953, and it had been an evanescent identity for a long time by 2007. All sources agree in attaching the name to Carnot Bay. Tindale's statement that Jabirr-Jabirr associations extended to Sandy Point on Beagle Bay is unlikely as Beagle Bay is generally agreed to be associated with Nyulnyul. Jabirr-Jabirr is generally described as south of Beagle Bay. Sandy Point is at the mouth of Beagle Bay. The next major point south on the coast is Low Sandy Point. Tindale's statement would more plausibly refer to Low Sandy Point rather than Sandy Point. Inland limits were inferred in accordance with drainage basins (Harvey ASEDA 802).",

The diagram on page 171 suggests that there may be more members of this unnamed language than Tirari (L14) and Diari.\nAustin (1981:5) reiterates his earlier observation of the close relationship between Dhirari and Diyari, but also identifies evidence of there being at least two dialects of Dhirari. He says the data in Reuther, collected at Killalpaninna (Northern Dhirari L69), differs from data originating in Muloorina (Southern Dhirari L70) in terms of vocabulary (69% common) but phonologically the two are nearly identical.\n\nAccording to Breen (1976:745), Dhirari forms a dialect chain with Ngamini L22, Midhaga L34, Dieri L17, Yaluyandi L31 and Garwali L35.",

There are several dialect or tribal names recorded, among which Breen lists Nhirrpi L46, Yawarrawarrka L23, Matja L47, Parlpamardramardra L45 and Ngananhina L48 as provided by his informants. Breen uses Yandruwandha as a cover term for the whole language. That is, Yandruwandha is used as a both language name and a dialect name.\n\nThe extent of Yandruwandha is uncertain. Breen's (2004) map places it largely within South Australia with an eastern edge in Queensland. Bowern's (2001) map has Yandruwandha extending into both Queensland and New South Wales. Consequently, in this database Yandruwandha is tentatively treated as a language of South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. Mathews' (1905:51-2) comments lend support to a Queensland connection; he says that Wonkamurra, Kullalli, Bunthamurra, Yanderwantha and Yowerwarrika are a 'community, or nation' and they all speak 'dialects of the same language'. However, it is not clear which variety of 'Wonkamurra', 'Kullali' and 'Bunthamurra' he refers to.\n\nYandruwandha is used in a language revitalisation program in Bourke (Wafer and Lissarrague 2008:291).",

It appears that some speakers of the Bulloo River Wangkumara moved from the Bulloo River area (Thargomindah) to the Wilson River area (Nockatunga area) and adopted some features of the Wilson River language (Breen 1971:12). McDonald and Wurm (1979:2), however, claim that the linguistic evidence supports Tindale's (1940) hypothesis of a migration in the opposite direction.\n\nWilson River Wangkumara is a member of the Karnic languages while the Bulloo River Wangkumara is member of 'Karna-Mari fringe' languages (Wafer and Lissarrague 2008:286-287). Breen (2007:18) describes Karna-Mari fringe languages as 'a discontinuous group of languages, mostly poorly attested, scattered between Karnic and Mari languages but not showing much connection with either or with one another. The only one well attested is also the most remote geographically, Kalkutungu.'\n\nIn this database, the code L25 was previously used to refer to both varieties of Wangkumara, given that the Wilson River (or Modern) Wangkumara originated in Bulloo River Wangkumara (or vice versa), even though two varieties are considered to belong to different language groups. However, as there is evidence of both varieties, and they are distinct, they are now treated individually in AUSTLANG and in the Thesaurus. Bulloo River Wangkumara retains the L25 code, while Wilson River Wangkumara (or Modern Wangkumara) has a new code, L68. Given the confusion between the two varieties, though, documentation for Wangkumara L68 may also be relevant.\n\nBreen (1971:18) says that Palpakunu L64 is a Jandruwanda L18 term for the 'Wilson River group of dialects, i.e. Mambangura L20, modern Wangkumara and Kungatutji L16, Punthamara and others now extinct'. Breen (1967:2) also states that the languages (though he goes on to refer to them as groups) spoken along the Wilson River are identical: Bundhamara (L26), Gungadudji L16, Wanggumara and Ngandangura L30.",

In Sutton (1973:44-45), Yirandhali (L42) is excluded from the Mari group since it shares less than 50 per cent vocabulary with its closest Maric neighbours. Terrill (1998:99), however, tentatively includes it, cautioning that it would be premature to rule out a genetic relationship between Yirandhali and the other Maric languages.\n\nPooroga, Dalleburra and Yirandali (and variants) have all been used to refer to this language. Oates (1975) says Dalleburra is a group name. Tindale (1974) says Pooroga is the language name of the Jirandali people. Bennett (1927) uses Dalleburra as both people and language name. Both Terrill (1998) and Sutton (1973) use Yirandhali (L42). Curr (1886, vol. 2,  pp. 460-463) gives two 'specimens' of language data for Pooroga, which he says were 'obtained probably from persons of distinct tribes'. Although no dialects are reported for this language, the lists are similar though certainly not identical.",

As L10 has been used for Adnyamathanha for some time, a new code, L55, has been applied to Wailpi.\n\nHercus (2007 p.c.) says Adnyamathanha people regard the Wailpi as the people from around Blinman. This is consistent with the location of Wailbi (L55) in Oates and Oates (1970). Hercus's informant said that Wailpi people talked 'heavy'.\n\nPreviously in the Thesaurus, Wailpi was treated as an alternative of Adnyamathanha but it now has its own authorised heading.\n\nDocumentation for Adnyamathanha may be relevant.",

Further, the two word lists that Tindale attributes to Ngurunta (Anonymous 'no. 70' and Reid in Curr 1886-87) are identified as Paakantyi D12 by Curr and also by Beckett (1958). Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:290) treat Ngurunta as a 'hypothetical' dialect of Yardliyawarra L7 on the basis of its location and the information provided in Hercus and Austin (2004:210).\n\nTindale (1974) says he included Ngurunta in Maljangapa L8 in his earlier work but he lists it separately in his 1974 work. He says that their survivors resided with Maljanjapa in post-European times.\n\nThe Mobile Language Team web site refers to the Ngurunta language as being closely related to Malyangapa but there is no separate Ngurunta page.",

        "language_comment": "According to Breen (1971:12, 27), McDonald and Wurm (1979:1-3), Bowern (2001:256, note 25) and Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:286), there are two varieties of Wangkumara: original Wangkumara, associated with the Bulloo River languages, and Modern Wangkumara, associated with the Wilson River languages. It appears that some speakers of Bulloo River Wangkumara moved from the Bulloo River area (Thargomidha) to the Wilson River area (Nockatunga area) and adopted some features of the Wilson River languages (Breen 1971:12). McDonald and Wurm (1979:2), however, claim that the linguistic evidence supports Tindale's (1940) hypothesis of a migration in the opposite direction.\n\nWilson River Wangkumara is a member of the Karnic languages while the Bulloo River Wangkumara is member of 'Karna-Mari fringe' languages (Wafer and Lissarrague 2008:286-287). Breen (2007:18) describes Karna-Mari fringe languages as 'a discontinuous group of languages, mostly poorly attested, scattered between Karnic and Mari languages but not showing much connection with either or with one another. The only one well attested is also the most remote geographically, Kalkutungu.'\n\nIn this database, the code L25 was previously used to refer to both varieties of Wangkumara, given that the Wilson River (or modern) Wangkumara variety originated in Bulloo River Wangkumara (or vice versa), even though the two varieties are considered to belong to different language groups. However, as there is evidence of both varieties and they are distinct, they hare differentiated in this database and the Thesaurus. Bulloo River Wangkumara retains the L25 code, while Wilson River Wangkumara (or Modern Wangkumara) has a new code, L68. Given the confusion between the two varieties, though, documentation for Wangkumara L25 may also be relevant.",

        "language_comment": "Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:303) mention an unpublished manuscript on Malynagapa grammar by Austin (1978). This material is not incorporated in the documentation score.\n\nTindale (1974) says that in his earlier work he included Ngurunta L65 within Maljangapa (L8), but in his 1974 work, he makes a distinction between the two. He says that the survivors of Ngurunta resided with Maljanjapa in post-European times. Further, Tindale says that both Wanjiwalku D21 people and Maljangapa people speak the same language, Wanjiwalku. According to Hercus and Austin (2004), however, Malyangapa had their own language.\n\nWadigali L12 may be a dialect of Malyangapa, as reported by Capell (1963) and Oates (1975), both based on Wurm who uses the word 'probably' in describign this relationship. Beckett, Hercus and Martin (2008) say Wadikali L12 is part of the 'closely-knit subgroup of Yarli languages' but they do not mention dialect status. The Mobile Language Team web site locates Wadigali to the 'north of the closely related language / dialect Malyangapa'.\n\nYardliyawara L7 is another potential dialect of Malyangapa, though Hercus and Austin (2004) only say that Yardliyawara and Malyangapa are 'close'.",

Ethnologue lists Tyeraity (N10) and Kuwema as alternative language names.\n\nGuwema (N10) is a non-Pama Nyungan language which is closely related to MalakMalak N22 and located in the Daly River region of the Northern Territory. Together they are classified as Northern Daly languages (Harvey, 2003:159). See also Glottolog \n \nThe neighbouring languages of Kuwema are MalakMalak, Matngele N12 and Kamu N32 (according to sparse information from collaborators). A relationship between MalakMalak and Kuwema is generally accepted (Dorothea Hoffmann, July 2016, p.c.).\n \nThe language name 'Tyeraity' (N10) (and variations in spelling used by Tryon, Glottolog and others) is actually Dak Jirratj (Hoffmann: Dek Tjerratj), the name of an estate linked to the Guwema language (Mark Harvey, July 2016, p.c.). Hoffmann says that Kuwema people also used the term Dek Kuwema to refer to a place (July 2016, p.c.).\n\nTryon classified two Daly language families as subgroups of a main Mulluk group: the Mulluk subgroup consisting of Mullukmulluk N22 and Tyeraity (N10) and the Daly subgroup: Matngala N12, Kamor N33 and Yunggor N26. However he also says that this Daly subgroup is more closely aligned with a Wogaity subgroup, which he classifies under a main Brinken-Wogaity group. (1974, 289-290). \n\nHarvey presents the case there is not sufficient evidence to support a genetic link between the Northern Daly languages, Guwema (N10) and MalakMalak N22, and the Eastern Daly languages Matngele N12 and Kamu N33 (Eastern Daly group) (2003:159, 172-3).\n \nNordlinger and Green use the spelling Tyerraty (N10) and include the names Kuwema, Dek Tyerraty and Nguluk Angguwe . Both Harvey and Hoffmann understand the term Nguluk Angguwe is a phrase constructed with the word nguluk 'language'. Hoffmann compares it with nguluk ngawe in MalakMalak 'my language' (July 2016, p.c.).",

However, there exists serious morphological or morphologico-typological differences between them (1974:187).\n\nTryon's early classification of Daly River languages as a single family has been revised and divided into five families; Reid and Harvey include an Anson Bay family consisting of Paccamalh N31 and Pungu-Pungu (N11)  (in Evans, 2003:13).\n\nNote that according to Green (2007 p.c.), the term PunguPungu is used in the modern Daly to refer to a western MalakMalak N22 dialect.

Consquently I assume that Gungarakany proper was associated with basically the lower-middle Reynolds (Harvey 2007 p.c.).\n\nNortheast of Mount Litchfield on midwaters of Reynolds River and on Adelaide River headwaters; an inland tribe extending to the western side of the Tabletop Range divide; northeast to vicinity of Rum Jungle and Batchelor (Tindale 1974).\n\nThe general associations were to the plain country, grassland and forested, on the Finniss River and the Reynolds River. There was little precise information on the limits of Gungarakany associations in 2007. In the south-west, Gungarakany was associated with Litchfield homestead, and this was the south-western limit of Gungarakany affilations. In the east boundaries are extrapolated from ecological zone changes - the shift from plain country to hill country on the Finniss and Reynolds, and drainage basin boundaries - in the Tabletop Range area. In the north, the boundary appears to have been the ecological zone change between the forested area on the southern shore of Bynoe Harbour, which were associated with Gulumoerrgin, and the grassland plains on the Finniss which were associated with Gungarakany. The western boundary abutted on to Batjjamalh affiliations. In the south, Litchfield homestead was associated with Gungarakany. Mt Litchfield was associated with Malak-Malak (Harvey ASEDA 802).\n\n\n",

The general association was to the plain country between the East Baines and the Fitzmaurice. The most certain general association was to the drainage of the Angalarri. The most reliable information, gathered in 1996, indicated that the upper Fitzmaurice, including Wombungi homestead was associated with Jaminjung. Bradshaw homestead was associated with Jaminjung. There was no clear evidence as to the status of Yabby Creek drainage, to the west of Bradshaw homestead. This area is an ecological zone change, and these are commonly associated with language zone changes. This general consideration suggests that the Yabby Creek drainage was associated with Murriny-Patha rather than Jaminjung. However, a Jaminjung association is possible. The southern bank of the Victoria between Big Horse Creek and the Pinkertons was associated with Jaminjung. There was no precise evidence on how far south Jaminjung associations extended. However, Jaminjung and Ngaliwurru are extremely close dialects linguistically. Every other known case of close dialects in Australia involves a common boundary. The only possible common boundary is if Jaminjung extended south to the Newcastle Ranges. There is no clear evidence as to whether the East Baines, downstream from the Newcastle Ranges was associated with Jaminjung. It could have been associated with Jiyilawoong (Harvey ASEDA 802).",

Tiwi verbs have complex internal structure and carry affixes, mainly prefixes, indicating subject, object, indirect object; tense, aspect and mood; time and location. (1-2). In modern forms of Tiwi complex verbal inflection is absent, replaced by analytic verb forms and isolating morphology. Nominals, adverbs etc are expressed with free form words. (Lee, 1987: 1-3).\n\nModern Tiwi incorporates influences from English and other languages, it is constantly evolving; Traditional Tiwi is spoken by older people; Tiwi Land Council Chairman Robert Tipungwuti expressed the view that 'It is the Tiwi's job to teach the Tiwi Language at home to their children not at school.' reinforcing the value of language to transmit culture, and the responsibility of the community to maintain Tiwi language .",

Inland associations included all drainages into Bynoe and Darwin Harbours. The Vernon Islands were associated with Gulumoerrgin. \nEastward limits: The eastern boundary is based on examination of place names. The distribution of apparently Gulumoerrgin place names as opposed to apparently Wuna place names matches to the ecological opposition between forested country  -  Gulumoerrgin, and grassland  -  Wuna. Southward limits: The boundary at the mouth of the Finniss River is based on statements by Aboriginal witnesses in the Kenbi Land Claim. The boundary in the area of the old North Australian railway and east to the Adelaide River is based on statements in early colonial reports about the southern boundary of Gulumoerrgin, and the statements of Warray informants about the northern boundary of Warray. The boundary between the mouth of the Finniss and the area of the old North Australian Railway is extrapolated. It is based on the ecological zone opposition between the wooded hill country on the southern shore of Bynoe Harbour  -  Gulumoerrgin, and the grassland floodplain of the lower Finniss  -  Gungarakany (Harvey ASEDA 802).\n\nThe Larrakia people are the traditional owners of the Darwin region. Our country runs from Cox peninsula in the west to Gunn Point in the north, Adelaide River in the east and down to the Manton Dam area southwards.

Together they are classified as Northern Daly languages (Harvey, 2003:159). See also Glottolog \n\nThe term MalakMalak can be used to refer to land, the language and the people (Yingguy et al, 2001:7).\n \nThe neighbouring languages of MalakMalak are Kuwema, Matngele N12 and Kamu N32 (according to sparse information from collaborators). A relationship between MalakMalak and Kuwema is generally accepted (Dorothea Hoffmann, July 2016, p.c.).\n \nTryon classified two Daly language families as subgroups of a main Mulluk group: the Mulluk subgroup consisting of Mullukmulluk (N22) and Tyeraity N10 and the Daly subgroup: Matngala N12, Kamor N33 and Yunggor N26. However he also says that this Daly subgroup is more closely aligned with a Wogaity subgroup, which he classifies under a main Brinken-Wogaity group (1974, 289-290). \n\nHarvey presents the case there is not sufficient evidence to support a genetic link between the Northern Daly languages, MalakMalak (N22) and Guwema N10, and the Eastern Daly languages Matngele N12 and Kamu N33 (Eastern Daly group) (2003:159, 172-3).\n\nNordlinger and Green include alternate names names Akana, Djiramo, Nguluk Wanggar, Valli-valli\n. Nguluk ngawe in MalakMalak means 'my language'; MalakMalak was also being referred to as nguluk wanggar 'your language' (Hoffmann, July 2016, p.c.).",

Two languages no longer spoken, Unwinymil N37.1 and Wulwulam N32 intervene; they indicate more in common with Warray than with Jawoyn, but the data are scarce, so their status cannot be established (2003:185, 299).\n\nHarvey concludes that Ngorrkgowo N178 and Wulwulam N32 are alternative names for the same or similar language varieties, or that they refer to distinct language varieties which share considerable overlap in countries associated with them (2003:299).

There was little precise information on the limits of Warray associations in 2007. In the east, Howley siding on the North Australian railway was associated with Warray. Brock's Creek was associated with Wulwulam. Mt Ringwood homestead appears to have been associated with Warray, but this appears to have been close to the eastern limits of Warray associations. The Margaret River drainage upstream from and including its junction with McCallum Creek was associated with Wulwulam. In the north, the junction of the Margaret and the Adelaide marked the northern limit of Warray affiliations. The Marrakai Creek drainage was associated with Wuna. The Manton and Darwin River drainages were associated with Gulumoerrgin. In the west, boundaries are extrapolated from ecological zone changes - the shift from savannah forest towards grassland on the Finniss, and drainage basin boundaries - in the Tabletop Range area. In the south, boundaries are extrapolated principally from drainage basin boundaries. In the plateau country area, Warray associations extended to approximately the level of Mt Shoebridge. Plateau Point and Hayes Creek were associated with Wagiman (Harvey ASEDA 802).\n",

There was little precise information on the limits of Wagiman associations in 2007. In the south-east, Ejong Billabong was associated with Dagoman, though this is close to the north-western limit of Dagoman associations. In the north, Hayes Creek was associated with Wagiman. Mt Osborne was not associated with Wagiman. Mt Shoebridge does not appear to have been associated with Wagiman. Plateau Point was associated with Wagiman. It is unclear how far upstream on the Douglas, Wagiman associations extended. In the west, limits have been extrapolated from drainage basin boundaries. Wagiman associations did not extend west of the Hayward Range. Fletcher's Gully Mine was associated with Ngan'gityemerri. In the south, limits have been extrapolated from drainage basin boundaries (Harvey ASEDA 802). \nAbout Dorisvale; southwest of Daly River; west of Ooloo; on Bamboo Creek; north to Douglas Homestead (Tindale 1974).\n",

Been recorded the language name as Wulna, and as Wuna; a third written form, Wunna, suggests the nasal is geminate (Breen, p.c. November 2018). Jack Wandi also spoke Minitya N42 which was mixed into the Wuna sessions (Harvey, 2001:5).\n\nBaker says that this language appears to be related to Limilngan N42, and thus it is tentatively classified in the Limilngan family. Evidence from comparing verbal paradigms, nominal cognates and locative case marking between Wuna and Limilngan N42 indicate a possible relationship, but Harvey is less certain. These correspondences could be the result of  inheritance from widespread Proto Australian forms or diffusion (2001:5).\n\nIt appears there has been some confusion between Wulna (N29) and Wulwulam N32, and it is likely that items on Wulna are described as being on Wulwulam.\n\nThis language has also been called Djerimanga, but this name was not recognised by Breen's collaborator Jack Wandi in 1980. Djerimanga occurs in Capell (1963) who notes 'Nothing is known beyond a mention by Eylmann, 1908'; it subsequently occurs in Oates and Oates 1970 and Tindale 1974.",

On the Fitzmaurice, Madjellindi Valley and Alligator Creek drainage were associated with Murriny-Patha. There is no precise evidence as to the limits of Murriny-Patha associations on the Fitzmaurice. However, the available evidence, collected 1996-2004, indicated that Murriny-Patha associations extended to the Yambarran Range and included the Laurie Creek drainage. There is no precise evidence as to how far upstream Murriny-Patha associations extended on the northern side of the Victoria. The major ecological zone change is in the Yabby Creek area. Language zone changes are generally associated with ecological zone changes. This suggests that the change from Murriny-Patha to Jaminjung was in the Yabby Creek area (Harvey ASEDA 802).\n\nPort Keats; east to the Macadam Range and south to Keyling Inlet at the mouth of Fitzmaurice River (native name Kemol); a coastal tribe with eight hordes extending inland for about 20 miles (30 km) (Tindale).\n\nWadeye community (previously Port Keats) (Blythe 2009:29-30).\n",

Agnes Lippo and Kitty Moffat confirmed that Banakula and Banagaya, south of the mouth of the Daly River, and Dirrktirrk, Nyikmingguny, Balgal, Kadjaluik, Bananggurini, and Budjut opposite the Peron Islands, are Wadjiginy camp-sites (Ford 1997).\n\nIn the earliest written reference to the Wadjiginy, dated 1874, surveyors exploring the hinterland of Darwin for the Overland Telegraphy route note that 'the Waggites are located to the westward, about Anson's Bay' (Wildey 1876:115). The 'Wangites' Reserve, proclaimed in 1892, granted the Wadjiginy title to 288 sq. miles between the Finnis and Daly Rivers (South Australian Government Gazette, 1892, cited in NLC 1979:140). Father McKillop of the Uniya Mission knew the 'Wogites' as 'a powerful tribe' with land on the left bank of the Daly (McKillop 1893:254); Parkhouse (1895:634) described them as 'westerly neighbours' of the Larakiya, beyond Shaol Bay. In 1894, Knut Dahl explored the Daly with a 'Wogait' guide. Dahl recalls the 'Wogait' as 'a tribe entirely different from the Valli Valli (Daly) people' and 'Wogait' territory as 'a very extensive coast area, reaching from the mouth of the Daly almost to Pport Darwin' (Dahl 1927:15, 128). Basedow (1907:2) locates the 'Wogait' to the west of the 'Larrekiya', from the Finniss River to Cape Ford. Stanner (1933:387) refers to them as 'a tribe which once lived in the Anson Bay district' (Ford 1997). ",

They met the Warray about Brock's Creek (Spencer fieldnote according to Harvey 2003:295). \n\nThe south-western neighbours of the Wulwulam were the Wagiman...According to Warray and Wagiman people Hayes Creek and Butterfly/Dougas Gorge are in traditional Wagiman country. To the south-east, Spencer states that the area from Pine Creek to Katherine was associated with the Jawoyn language. However, in the early 1900s, while the area around the upper Ferguson river was apparently associated with the Ngarlahmi dialect of Jawoyn, the area immediately to the south of Pine Creek on the Cullen and mid-Ferguson was associated with the Dagoman-speaking Gayn-jiwortbort clan. Wulwulam appears to have bordered diecretly onto Jawoyn in the west. The upper Mary River above Moine appears to be associated with the Jawoyn language (Harvey 2003:297 - information provided by Merlan). \n\n... the upper McKinlay and Margaret rivers (Harvey 2007 p.c.) \n\nThere is little precise information on the affiliations of Wulwulam. In his 1912 fieldnotes Spencer records that the territory of the Wulwulam included Pine Creek, Burrundie, Mt Wells, and Yam Creek. However, it is more likely that Pine Creek was associated with Dagoman, with Wulwulam affilations coming in close on the north.. He records that they met the Warray about Brock's Creek. The few other older sources which describe the boundary between the Warray and their south-eastern neighbours locate the boundary in the Brock's Creek - Grove Hill area. The zone of change from Warray to Wulwulam was between Howley and Brock's Creek.The upper Margaret drainage above and including its junction with McCallum was associated with Wulwulam. There was no other information on the affiliations of this variety in 2007. The northern boundary is extrapolated from the ecological zone change from mostly hill country (Wulwulam) to mostly plain country (Uwinymil). In the east, affiliations may have extended to include Mary River homestead, but this area could have been affiliated with Jawoyn (Harvey ASEDA 802).\n\n\n",

The Daly from upstream of Browns Creek to Chilling Junction was associated with Kamu. The following places were associated with Kamu: Woolianna, Nauiyu Nambiyu, Daly River Crossing, Mt Hayward, Mt Thomas. In the east, the Hayward Range appears to have been the eastern boundary of Kamu. There is no precise information on the northern limits. Blackfellow Creek was associated with Kamu, and it appears that the upper Reynolds generally was associated with Kamu. The western limit was the change from hill to lowland country.

The four varieties are Wurrugu, Burdinmanduwij N185, Wurdang N181 and Ngardawuli N179. Further, Evans (2007 p.c.) comments that Wurrugu is most likely what was recorded as Popham Bay language by Earl (1853).\n\nIn his 1846 publication, Earl describes how the four groups of the Cobourg peninsula are identified by the word for 'no' in their respective dialects. What he refers to as 'Popham Bay language' in his 1853 'The native races of the Indian archipelago', he identifies as 'Iyi' in 1846. Tindale (1974) says that Earl's 'Iyi' is the same as modern Iwaidja N39. (Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that 'iyi' is the Iwaidja word for 'yes' (not 'no')). These two assessment appear contradictory, but Powell (1982:93) notes Tindale's suggestion that Iyi and Yarlo (Earl's Port Essington tribe) may be 'older sub-tribal designations of Warooko'.",

The northern extent of Dagoman country is now difficult to establish (Merlan 1994:7). \n\nPine Creek to Adelaide River (Top End Handbook). \n\nNortheast of the middle Daly River; south to the junction of the Flora and Katherine rivers; at Jindare (Tindale 1974). \n\nThe general association was to the Daly-Katherine Basin from the junction of the Daly with Stray Creek to and including the first gorge on the Katherine. There was little precise information on the limits of Dagoman in 2007. In the east Leech Lagoon marked the eastern limit of Dagoman associations. Durrinyan Creek was associated with Dagoman. Lake Duggan on Durrinyan Creek was associated with Dagoman. The drainage of King River, save for the headwaters, was associated with Dagoman. The headwaters, however, including King River homestead were apparently associated with Jawoyn. In the north, Copperfield Creek was associated with Dagoman. The Ferguson below its junction with the Cullen was associated with Dagoman. Stray Creek drainage was associated with Dagoman. In the west, Ejong billabong was associated with Dagoman, and appears to have been close to the western limit of Dagoman. It appears that Jinduckin Creek was associated with Wagiman. In the south, the Flora River was associated with Dagoman. Its southern tributaries were associated with Wardaman. Lower Scott Creek, below the Victoria Highway crossing and Limestone Creek were associated with Dagoman (Harvey ASEDA 802). \n\nNortheast of the middle Daly River; south to the junction of the Flora and Katherine rivers; at Jindare (Tindale 1974).\n",

However, in Harvey (ASEDA 802) Ngomburr is listed as a separate language.\n\nHarvey (1992:12, 2002:14) reports that, according to one informant, Magabalal was the Gundjeihmi N71 name for Umbugarla and Ngombur people, and that the Kunwinjku N65 equivalent of Magabalal was Gun-garrigen (N14?), though he cautions that he was unable to confirm this more generally. Harvey tentatively classifies Bugurnidja N42.1 as a variety of Umbugarla proper (Harvey 2002:14).",

        "location_information": "Jawoyn-language clans such as Pertpert, Polmo and others appear to have ranged and perhaps been affiliated to country high up on the Katherine River in present-day Arnhem Land. However, research has shown the far northern Jawoyn area to be less well known to Pine Creek and Katherine-resident Jawoyn people than are lower parts of the Katherine catchment (Merlan & Jacq 2005:3).\n\n... while the area around the upper Ferguson river was apparently associated with the Ngarlahmi dialect of Jawoyn, the area immediately to the south of Pine Creek on the Cullen and mid-Ferguson was associated with the Dagoman-speaking Gayn-jiwortbort clan. Wulwulam appears to have bordered diecretly onto Jawoyn in the west. The upper Mary River above Moine appears to be associated with the Jawoyn language (Harvey 2003:297 - information provided by Merlan).\n\nThe general associations were to the southern half of the Arnhemland plateau and adjacent, with the exception that in the south-west, the edge of the plateau and adjacent areas were associated with Dagoman. There was little precise information on the limits of Jawoyn affiliations in 2007. In the east, Mainoru homestead and the Mainoru River upstream of the homestead were associated with Jawoyn. It is not certain how far downstream of the homestead Jawoyn affiliations extended. In the north-east, boundaries are extrapolated from drainage basin boundaries. The Wilton and Mann River drainages in the plateau were generally associated with Dalabon. The East Alligator and Deaf Adder Creek drainages were generally associated with Bininj Gunwok. However, it is possible that the headwaters of some or all of these drainages were associated with Jawoyn. In the north-west, Jawoyn associations appear to have extended to approximately the level of Mt Partridge. Goodparla homestead was associated with Jawoyn. In the west there is no definite information. The upper Mary River was affiliated with Jawoyn. Mary River homestead may have been associated with Jawoyn. In the south-west, the first Katherine Gorge was associated with Dagoman, but most of Seventeen Mile Creek appears to have been associated with Jawoyn. The headwaters of King River, including King River homestead, appear to have been associated with Jawoyn. Leech Lagoon was associated with Dagoman, and the King River from at least level with Leech Lagoon was associated with Dagoman. In the south, Maranboy, Barunga, and Beswick all appear to have been associated with Jawoyn. The name of Easter Billabong at the junction of the Roper River and Maranboy Creek is Biruhmi (h = glottal stop). The glottal stop is found only in Jawoyn, and as such this is a Jawoyn name. It appears to be the southern limit of Jawoyn associations (Harvey ASEDA 802).\n\nKatherine River and headwaters; south to Maran-boy; west to about Katherine (Tindale 1974).",

Mackay and Woods report that Dangbon is the Gunwinjgu N65 word for Dalabon, adding that Dalabon 'is the same as Dangbon but rough' (in Oates, 1975:12) implying some difference.\n\nIn explaining the etymology of the term Dalabon (dal\u00fb- 'mouth' + bon 'go'), Evans and Merlan mention that Dangbon (N60) and Ngalkbon N76 are 'parallel formations based on the root for \"mouth\" in Bininj Gun-wok' N186 'and Jawoyn' N57, 'used by speakers of each of those languages respectively, though Dalabon speakers will themselves sometimes use these forms, depending on who they are in frequent contact with. They also report that Buwan N89 tends to be used by Rembarrnga speakers and that it may reflect a regular sound correspondence of 'o' to 'uwa' (i.e. bon > buwan) ((2003:269).\n\nCutfield (2011) expands on this, indicating that 'Dalabon is also known as Dangbon, Ngalkbon, or Buwan. These latter three names are terms used by the Kune N70 and Mayali N44, Jawoyn N57 and Rembarrnga N73 respectively, to refer to Dalabon.'\n\nEvans et al. (in Bordulk 2012:12) acknowledge some dialectal differences between Dangbon and Dalabon: 'There are a few differences between 'Top End' or northern Dalabon and 'bottom end' or southern Dalabon, which are sometimes characterized in terms of the difference between Dangbon and Ngalkbon.'",

Alpher, Evans and Harvey (2003) include it in the Gunwinyguan group while Merlan (2003) argues that it belongs to the Marra-Alawic (~Maran) family group, see Alawa N92, Marra N78 and Warndarrang N120.",

Gun-narta N191 and Gun-narda call their dialects Gu-jingarliya (Glasgow, 1994:7). Glasgow describes Gurrgoni or Gun-gurrgoni (N75) as a dialect of the Burarra N82 language family (1994:7). An-barra and Martey peoples refer to their dialects (Gun-narta N191 and Gun-narda N190) as Gu-jingarliya and Mu-golarra aka Mukarli people refer to theirs (Gun-nartpa N81) as Gu-jarlabiya. An-barra and Martay people were called Burarra by their eastern neighbours; all three dialect groups share close cultural and social interaction (Glasgow, 1994:7).\nBarara in Tindale is listed in this database as (N81), which corresponds to Gunaidbe in Oates and Oates (1970:14).

        "language_comment": "Burarra (N82) is the language of the Burarra and Gun-nartpa N81 people from the Blyth and Cadell River regions and Maningrida in North-Central Arnhem land. The Burarra language consists of three dialects: An-barra people speak Gun-narta N191; Martay people speak Gun-narda N190 and Mu-golarra people (also called Mukarli) speak Gun-nartpa N81 (Glasgow and Glasgow, 2011). Gun-narta N191 and Gun-narda call their dialects Gu-jingarliya (Glasgow, 1994:7). Glasgow describes Gurrgoni or Gun-gurrgoni (N75) as a dialect of the Burarra N82 language family (1994:7). An-barra and Martey peoples refer to their dialects (Gun-narta N191 and Gun-narda N190) as Gu-jingarliya and Mu-golarra aka Mukarli people refer to theirs (Gun-nartpa N81) as Gu-jarlabiya. An-barra and Martay people were called Burarra by their eastern neighbours; all three dialect groups share close cultural and social interaction (Glasgow, 1994:7).\nBased on a comparison of verb tense/status suffixes, Green classifies Burarra N82, Gurr-goni N75, Ndjebbana N74 and Nakkara N80 as a 'Maningrida subgroup' of the larger Gunwinjguan language family, a refinement of the earlier classification of Gurr-goni as a member of the 'Bureran' family (Capell, Voegelin and Voegelin in Green, 1995:4-5). Oates (1975:18) equates Burera (N82) with Burarra N135, and she subsumes Bureda N135 under Burera (N82). They are however separate.\n",

The language groups identified are Mara N112, Ngandi N90, Alawa N92, Nunggubuyu N128, Rittarrngu N104, Wandarang N120 and Ngalakan N77.\"\n\nBrett Baker (2010) looks at the evidence for Yukul (N85) and suggests that, based on indirect linguistic evidence and inferences about social organisation from historical records, it was 'an ethnolinguistic identity on a par with 'Ngalakgan' N77, 'Marra' N112 and so on', likely decimated by conflict with pastoralists soon after contact in the late 1800s.",

The most certain general association of Yukul was to the lower Roper, other than the mouth which was associated with Warndarrang. Given the linguistic connection to Marra, it would appear that there was a common boundary with Marra. Given the known territorial affiliations of Alawa, Marra, and Warndarrang, this common boundary was most plausibly between the middle Towns River the Limmen Bight River. As such, it appears that the middle Towns was associated with Yukul. There was no precise information in 2007 on the affiliations of the drainages originating in the southern side of Downers Range. However, names such as Namiliwirri suggest that some at least of this was associated with Yukul (Harvey ASEDA 802).",

See also Ngalkbon N76.\n\nAlthough the current thinking is that Buan is equivalent to Dalabon N70, there are a number of publications that refer to Buan as a language in its own right, some of which also include linguistic data, namely Capell 1942 (though it should be noted that he subsequently (1962, 1963, 1971) goes on to treat Buan as a dialect of Dalabon) and West 1964.

Van Egmond concurs with Heath, concluding that Enindhilyakwa N151 is genetically related to Wubuy N128 and Ngandi (N90) and is thus a member of the Gunwiynguan family (2012:315).\n\nBaker's assessment of the complex non-past inflections in Ngandi (N90) and Nunggubuyu N128, and their closest cognates being found in Maningrida languages, suggests that their relationship with Gunwiynguan remains uncertain (2004:340).",

Several sources describe it as belonging to a subgroup with Marra N112 and Warndarrang N120 (Sharpe 1972; Heath 1978 in Sharpe 2008:59). Merlan (1989, 2003) argues for the addition of Mangarrayi N78 to this subgroup, known as Maran and Marra-Alawic. \n\nBaker (2006) questions the validity of the subgroup, due to the apparently unrelated finite verb forms. Sharpe examines the evidence in favour of their relatedness, and suggests, 'While Baker may be right in saying these languages are not from one linguistic family, the most plausible hypothesis at the present time is that they are related at a considerable time depth, even if a number of their features may have other sources' (2008:61).",

The Cox River was associated with Alawa until the point where it turns to flow east-west close to the junction with the Limmen Bight River. The east-west running reach of the Cox was associated with Marra. The headwaters fo the Arnold River appear to have been associated with Ngarnka. The following places were associated with Alawa: Cox River homestead, Nutwood Downs homestead, Hodgson River homestead, Minyerri, Old St Vidgeon homestead (on Mountain Creek). There was no precise information in 2007 as to whether Old Tanumbirini homestead was associated with Alawa or Ngarnka (Harvey ASEDA 802).\n",

This appears to be the northernmost tribe in eastern Arnhem Land to preserve the usual Australian tribal structure. It has both Dua and Jiritja clans. Past confusion about the territorial limits of the tribe have been accentuated by misidentifications of the Goyder River, which terminates in the Arafura Swamp. A coastal estuarine stream that flows from its northern margin is the true Glyde River. The Woolen River, which lies to the east, has been incorrectly marked as the Goyder on some anthropologists sketch maps. Thus Warner, Thomson, and Berndt are writing about different rivers when they speak of the Goyder (Tindale 1974).\n",

These are creative responses by people without a common language and are used in restricted domain, such as trade. They are often the result of colonial impositions on Indigenous populations. Pidgins become creolised when a generation of people use and expand the contact language and it develops into a full language, capable of meeting all communicative demands in all social contexts. There are differing views regarding the emergence of Kriol (see Harris 1993:147-9; Munro and Koch in Ponsonnet, 2010:165) in the Northern Territory including the influence of local sub-strate languages and of New South Wales and Queensland pidgins. The 2011 census for Kriol speakers is 4,000, but linguists estimate the real number is closer to 20,000. Kriol is used in churches, education and other social spheres such as the Kriol edition of ABC Radio News. However, many Aboriginal people view Kriol as being responsible for the loss of traditional languages; others argue that colonisation and inequality account for the loss of these languages and the emergence of Kriol (Dixon, nd: ). Well known varieties of Kriol include Roper River Kriol and Barunga Kriol, both are included under the code (P4) in the database. Creole spoken in Torres Strait, Torres Strait Creole P2 is listed separately in this database. See also Broome Pearling Lugger Pidgin P3. ",

It became the first language of a generation of children and thus expanded its functions beyond a contact language (the pidgin) and became Torres Strait Creole. Due to its provenance it is related to Tok Pisin in New Guinea, Bislama in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands Pijin. Torres Strait Creole has been spoken by six generations and is one of the three Indigenous languages of the Torres Strait, along with Kala Yagaw Ya Y1 / Kalaw Kawaw Ya Y2 and eastern Meriam Mir Y3, although it has less status than those traditional languages (Shnukal, 2004:7).

McDonald (2002:15) comments that Ngawait (S10), Nganguruku S6, Ngaiawang S7 and Ngaralti S4 seem to be closely related each other, and Wafer and Lissarrague (2008) group them together under the 'Lower Riverland language'. Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:31) also note that these names are likely to be dialects rather than 'alternative designations', citing the distinct locations and differences in kinship terms described in Radcliffe-Brown (1918:243). However, the Mobile Language Team treats Ngawadj, Ngangaruku and Ngayawang S7 each as distinct languages, while Walsh (1981) treats Ngawait as one of four dialects of Yuyu S19, the other dialects being Erawirung S12, Ngintait S18 and Ngarkat S9.\n\nIt appears that the only available resource on Ngawadj is kinship terms in Radcliffe-Brown (1918:243).\n\nThe term Meru is sometimes applied to Ngawadj and several other languages in the area, being the word for 'man' in those languages. Radcliffe-Brown (1918:246) notes that this includes the 'Nganguruku and Ngaiyan S7? languages, and probably those of the Nanait (S10)?, Yiran S12, Yuyu and Ngintait also'. Dowling (1990:25) remarks that 'the Jirawirung S12 and Ngawait were part of a major linguistic group, the Meru, which extended west along the Murray River from the Pyap Bend and south towards Lake Alexandrina (Tindale 1974) and included the Ngaiawang, Nganguruku and Ngintait speakers.'",

Tindale's location and alternative names for Meintangk roughly correspond to Smith's five groups, excepting perhaps Bungandidj (S13) in name (but not necessarily location). Note that Berndt and Berndt (1993:305) mention there being both Milipi-speaking and non-Milipi speaking Pungadidji (S13). Ward (in Campbell 1934:25) also makes a distinction between the Penganka S14 and Boandik (S13) groups, 'who formerly occupied the country from Mount Gambier to Tatiara. The dominion of the Boandiks comprised the southerly portion of that area, and the Pengankas roamed from Penola northwards.' Milipi may be the name of the language Smith refers to.",

O'Connor (1994:24) says it is believed there were seven groups, using the location reported in Tindale (from Lacepede Bay, north to Granite Rocks near Kingston, south to Cape Jaffa and east to Lucindale, Blackford, Keilira and Naracoorte, and inland from Lake Hawdon to Mosquito Creek) and noting that 'the horde whose land was in the Penola area was known as the Pinchunga or Pinejunga S78 and one south east from Kingston, the Witchinjunga S72'.\n\nFurther, Berndt and Berndt (1993) report what Tindale identifies as Meindangk as being distinct from (though adjacent to) Tangani S11; Tangani being related to Yaralde S8, a dialect of Ngarrindjeri S69, and Meintangk being part of the 'Milipi'\nlanguage. The name Milipi may correspond to what Smith (1880:ix) describes as the five groups of the south-east (of South Australia), 'each occupying its own territory and using different dialects of the same language', comprising Booandik S13, Pinechunga S78, Moatatunga S76, Wichantunga S72, and Polijunga S79. Though they use it as a language name, Berndt and Berndt do not seem certain of the status of the name, noting that it 'was probably a clan name'. Consequently, Milipi is not included in this database, nor as a language heading in the Thesaurus.\n\nCampbell's (1934) description of the Pengangka group may be Meintangk, based on both the location and the similarity of the name, as might Taplin's (1879) 'Penola tribe' vocabulary.",

Note that Dixon does not include Bindjali in his 2002 classification, though this name has been used by several subsequent sources. This language was previously listed in the Thesaurus as Bedaruwidj / Tatiara but Tatiara does not appear in any contemporary sources.\n\nClark (1996:20) groups Bindjali, Bodaruwitj and 'Weregadjali' as alternative names for the same language, commenting that Bodaruwitj is probably a pejorative name assigned by outsiders. Clark (1996, 2005) lists Weregadjali as a 'sub-dialect' of Bindjali, which he says is confirmed by Crouch (n.d.), Haynes (in Curr 1887), and Mathews (1904). However, neither Haynes nor Mathews mentions the name (the Crouch item is not held in the AIATSIS collection) and there appears to be no language data available.",

In his later work, Clark (2005:14) includes all four varieties - Jardwadjali, Nundadjali, Jagwadjali and Mardidjali - as dialects of the same language, which he terms Jardwadjali (thus using Jardwadjali as both language and dialect name).\n\nDocumentation on Jardwadjali S27 may be relevant.",

Hope and Hercus 2009 also appear to treat Yuyu and Jari Jari S24 as either the same language or a very closely related dialect, together with Yitha Yitha D7.) On the other hand, Yuyu is treated as an alternative name for Yirawirung S12 by the Mobile Language Team, and for Ngintait by the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages. \n\nWafer and Lissarrage (2008) treat Yuyu as one of three dialects of their 'Upper Riverland language', the other two being Ngintait and Yirawirung.\n\nHorgen (2004) contains some grammatical description of Yuyu.

Blake (2003:2) also doubts the authenticity of the name Gunditjmara and uses 'the Warrnambool language' instead.\n\nUsing Dhauwurd Wurrung as both language (cover term) and dialect name, Clark (2005) lists the following dialects: Wulluwurrung S81, Dhauwurdwurrung (S20), Gaiwurrung S74, Gurngubanud S75 and Bi:gwurrung S77. Further, Clark (2005) links Dhauwurdwurrung to Giraiwurrung S25 and Djargurdwurrung S73 as a language continuum. Blake (2003:7) has a similar grouping but treats all as dialects of a single language. \n\nBlake (2003:7) notes that 'some dialect differentiation can be discerned' but that it is difficult to be certain how many given the 'confusing number of dialect names in the sources'. He identifies Pikwurrung S77, Kunkupanut S75 and Wuluwurrung S81, and also makes reference to Dawson's (1881) list: Kirrae wuurong (Kiriwurrung) S25, Katubanuut S71, Warn tallin (Warn thalayn) S73?, Kii wuurong (Kayiwurrung) S74, Kuurn kopan not (Kurnkupanut) S75, Peek whurrong (Pikwurrung) S77, Wirngill gnat tallinanong S80 and Wuluwurrung S81 (Blake 2003:8-9, 12).\n\nThe Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages uses the name Gunditjmara as both a people name and a cover term for a slightly different group of languages: Gadubanud S71, Gulidjan S30, Djargurd Wurrong S73, Keerray Woorroong S25, Woolwoowurrong S81, Koorn Kopan Noot S75, Kee Wurrong S74, Peek Wurrong S77 and Dharwurd Wurrong.",

The western boundary with Yarijari is unclear, though Chalka Creek, which feeds the Mournpool lakes from the Murray River, is a likely boundary. Although the Ladjiladji eastern boundary is uncertain, we do know that Dadidadi was spoken at Narcooyia Creek, south-east of Robinvale, so this may be an eastern boundary marker of Ladjiladji.

Walsh (1981) treats it as a dialect of Wemba Wemba D1, which is a Kulin language (Kulin being a language group covering much of Victoria). According to Clark (1996:15), Jarijari (S24) is very closely related to Wadiwadi D4, another Kulin language. Blake and Reid (1998) locate Yati Yati (S24) between Ledji-Ledji S23 and Dadi-Dadi S28 - both Kulin languages - though they do not discuss it. Blake's paper, Kulin and its neighbours (online publication available at http://www.latrobe.edu.au/linguistics/blakeb.html), does not include Jari Jari either.\n\nOn the other hand, Horgen (2004:3) seems to treat Yerreyerre (S24) as another name for Keramin D6.1. Ray (1925:7) provides a small amount of data on 'Kemendok', which he claims is 'the language of the Yerreyerre tribe about Mildura'. Kemendok is - like Keramin - listed as an alternative name for Kureinji D6.1 in this database, following Tindale (1974) and O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966).\n\nWafer and Lissarrague (2008:30) suggest that similar names may refer to two separate language varieties, one which is grouped together with Keramin D6.1 in their 'Northern Sunraysia language' group and another which is associated with Madhi-Madhi D8.",

Krishna-Pillay says that, historically, there was no general name for this language (p. 17) and discusses the various labels that have been used, including Gunditjmara (p.18). \n\nThe Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages follows Clark in treating Keerray Woorroong as a separate language.",

In his later work, Clark (2005:14) includes all four varieties - Jardwadjali, Nundadjali, Jagwadjali and Mardidjali - as dialects of the same language, which he terms Jardwadjali (thus using Jardwadjali as both language and dialect name).",

A brief comparison of a few word list items from each suggests that the two are the same. The location descriptions of each overlap, though the location of Lewurrung is much smaller, completely contained within that of Dja Dja Wurrung. Tully (1997:14) mentions Dja Dja Wurrung country being divided amongst fourteen clans, each speaking a slightly different version of Dja Dja Wurrung.

Weki Weki and Warga Warga refer to the same language (Clark 1996, 2005), of which the community-preferred name is Weki Weki.\n\nThe name Piangil, a place name, has been linked to both Weki Weki and Wadi Wadi D4. According to Clark (1990:404), Dixon (Working Papers) has suggested that Wadiwadi D4 was divided into two dialects, 'Piangil' and 'non-Piangil'. Blake and Reid (1998:4-5) note that 'there are two tongues that bear the name Wadi-Wadi, one centred around Swan Hill and the other around Piangil'. The 'Piangil' Wadi Wadi was previously listed as an alternative name for both Wadi Wadi D4 and Weki Weki (S33). Blake, Hercus, Morey and Ryan (2011) comment, 'There is a possibility that what we call Wati Wati (Piangil) was in fact the language of the Weki Weki people, though this cannot be proven.' Based on this, a separate record for Wadi Wadi (Piangil) D67 has been created, while also noting that the two names may refer to the same language.\n\nPreviously there was a Thesaurus heading for Warga Warga (S21), Wadi Wadi (D4) and Biangil / Biyangil / Piangil (S33).\nGiven the common identity of Weki Weki and Warga Warga, and the liklihood (but not certainty) of 'Piangil Wadi Wadi' being the language of the Weki Weki people, the Thesaurus now has language headings for Weki Weki (S33), Wadi Wadi (D4) and Wadi Wadi (Piangil) (D67). However, given the uncertainty around the identity of Wadi Wadi (Piangil), documentation for Weki Weki and Wadi Wadi may also be relevant.",

He refers to speakers of these dialects as Kulin, noting that this is a narrower use of the term than is usual.\n\nBlake (1991:30, 49) also indicates a possible additional dialect in the northern Thagungwurrung area, Ngoorra S83, which he says takes its name from the Ngoora-yilam clan. Blake reports that this dialect is identified by Barwick (1984:125), but says it may simply have been an alternative name for Thagungwurrung.\n\nOates (1975:189) subsumes S36 (Woiwurung in Oates and Oates 1970) under S37 (Daungwurung in Oates and Oates 1970), and assigns Woiwurung as a standard name for S37.",

Walsh (1981) largely follows this analysis, with the exception of using Muk-thang as the cover term S68 as well as one of the dialects S45, and with the addition of Bidhawal S49 as a fourth dialect. Of Bidawal S49, Howitt (1996:79-81) comments that it is a mixture of Kurnai, Ngarigo S46 and 'Murring' (i.e. a Yuin language).",

Curr (1887) details the Bangerang groups, noting that they all spoke closely related dialects and always referred to themselves collectively as Bangerang (vol. 3, p. 569). However, several of the clan names attributed to Bangerang in Curr (1887) are linked to Yorta Yorta in James (1897), as noted by Bowe and Morey (1999:8). \n\nAccording to Bowe and Morey (1999:3), the term Bangerang refers to some of the Yorta Yorta speaking groups. Sommer (in Bowe 2002:107) says that the early linguistic literature suggests that Bangerang was both a specific name for two groups, the Wongatpan and the Towroonban, as well as a cover term for ten 'bands' including speakers of Yoda yoda D2 and Yabala yabala S38.\n\nTindale (1974), placing 'Jotijota' D2 on the New South Wales side of the border, includes Yoorta Yoorta / Yurt among the alternative name for his Pangerang (S40), identifying it as an exonym applied by 'northerners and the Ngurelban'.\n\nClark (1990) treats Bangerang as an alternative name for Yorta Yorta, as do Wafer and Lissarrague (though noting that this may be only partly applicable).\n\nEira (2014 p.c.) says that, from the current perspective, Bangerang and Yorta Yorta are both people names and the names of very closely related language varieties, the distinct identities of which are highly salient to the contemporary communities.\n\nPreviously the code S40 included not only Bangerang but Kwat Kwat S97 and Waveroo S89. Waveroo is a variant of Waywurru S89 so this has been removed from S40. Further, although the identity of Kwat Kwat is uncertain, it is treated as a distinct language variety in Clark 1996 (as a dialect of Waywurru), Bowe 2002 (as 'a dialect, or a set of dialects, of the macro-language grouping Bangerang/Yorta Yorta'), and Bowe and Morey 1999 (as a 'subgroup of the Yorta Yorta / Bangerang macro group'). Consequently, Kwat Kwat now has its own code, S97.",

Curr and Mathews both show that Pangerang hordes extended a little way downriver from Echuca on both banks; these western hordes were called Jabalaljabala by downriver tribes. Three of Curr's Pangerang hordes are separated as the Kwatkwat. The hordes shown by Curr north of the Murray River belong to other tribes. Color plates 43-46 are relevant (Tindale).\nCurr (1833, 1887, vol.3, p566ff) describes the use of the term Bangerang to refer primarily to the Wongatban and Towroonban clans who lived in the Lower Moira (on the Victorian side of the Murray River); however, he explains that the term was also used more generally by other tribes to refer to the total group now referred to as Yorta Yorta (Bowe and Morey 1999: 3). \n",

Data treated as Dhudhuroa is variously labelled Dhudhuroa and 'Barwidgee, from Wodonga along Upper Murray'.

Gardner (1996:5) and Hercus (1969), however, treat it as the name of a group whose language is Kurnai S68.\n\nHowitt (1996 (1904):73) reports that the name Krauatungalung is the name of a clan whose language is called Thangquai, being one of three dialects spoken by the Kurnai S68 people. Walsh (1981) largely follows this analysis, with the exception of using Muk-thang S68 as the cover term as well as one of the dialects, and with the addition of Bidhawal S49 as a fourth dialect. Of Bidawal S49, Howitt (1996 (1904):79-81) comments that it is a mixture of Kurnai S68, Ngarigo S46 and 'Murring' (i.e. a Yuin language).\n\nClark (2011:38-49) analysed the primary and secondary sources of information on the boundaries of Krauatangalung S48 and the neighbouring Birrdhawal S49 language. He concludes that, contrary to Wesson's (1994, 2000, 2002) work, and supportive of Fesl's (1985) and Thompson's (1985) findings, 'the Birrdhawal were land-locked and did not have any coastline as a southern boundary', and that 'the strip of coastal land between the Snowy River and Point Hicks or Wingan Inlet' belonged to the Krauatangalung S48.",

He found 51 per cent common vocabulary, suggesting either languages in the same subgroup or dialects of the same language. He acknowledges the uncertainty of this analysis, based as it is on such limited data, concurring with Wafer and Lissarrague's (2008:95) conclusions that 'for present purposes we treat it as being distinct from other Victorian Border languages...it is unlikely to be a linguistic isolate, and the evidence suggests that it is most likely related to Kurnai (Ganaay)'.\n\nNote that Howitt (1996 1904:79-81) says the Bidawal language is a mixture of Kurnai S68, Ngarigo S46 and 'Murring' (i.e. a Yuin language).",

According to Tindale (1974), Nganguruku was sometimes grouped with Ngaiawang S7 but the vocabularies show differences. McDonald (2002:15) comments that Nganguruku, Ngaiawang, Ngaralti S4 and Ngawait S10 seem to be closely related each other, and Wafer and Lissarrague (2008) group them together under the 'Lower Riverland language'. Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:31) also note that these names are likely to be dialects rather than 'alternative designations', citing the distinct locations and differences in kinship terms described in Radcliffe-Brown (1918:243). The Mobile Language Team treats Ngangaruku, Ngayawang S7 and Ngawadj S10 as distinct languages.\n\nThe term Meru is sometimes applied to Ngangaruku and several other languages in the area, being the word for 'man' in those languages. Radcliffe-Brown (1918:246) notes that this includes the 'Nganguruku and Ngaiyan S7? languages, and probably those of the Nanait S10?, Yiran S12, Yuyu S19 and Ngintait S18 also'. Dowling (1990:25) remarks that 'the Jirawirung S12 and Ngawait S10 were part of a major linguistic group, the Meru, which extended west along the Murray River from the Pyap Bend and south towards Lake Alexandrina (Tindale 1974) and included the Ngaiawang, Nganguruku and Ngintait speakers'.",

He does not give a name for this dialect.\n\nAccording to Attenbrow (2002:34-35), some anthropologists and linguists used this term as a group or language name, but there is no evidence to suggest that Aboriginal people used the term Eora to refer to a specific group or language. Attenbrow says that this term is now used to refer to the original inhabitants of the area between Port Jackson and Botany Bay, or sometimes the entire Sydney region, and the language of this area is a (coastal) dialect of Darug S64.\n\nSteele (2005:5-6) also says that Eora is neither language nor people name but simply the word for 'man'. He proposes Biyal-Biyal as an alternative name, explaining the reasoning for this and taking, as support, a quote from Meston in Smith (2004:3): 'but they were not speaking the old Beeahlba dialect of the Sydney blacks'.\n\nTroy (in Thieberger 1994:61) applies the name 'the Sydney language' since 'there is no record of the name given to the language by its speakers and no word recorded meaning \"language\"'.\n\nGiven the lack of any well-established alternative name, this database retains Eora as the reference name.",

She identifies the coastal dialect of Darug S64, in other words Eora S61, as being spoken in the area identified as Guringai (i.e. the north shore of Port Jackson) by Capell (1970). \n\nLissarrague (2006) treats Kuringgai as a people name, describing the Hunter River  -  Lake Macquarie language S99 as spoken by people now known as Awabakal S66, Kuringgai, Wonnarua S63 and possibly Geawegal E1. In her later work (Wafer and Lissarrague 2008:160-164), Kuringgai/Karikal (S62) is treated as the name of a dialect of the Hunter River  -  Lake Macquarie language S99. Their analysis concludes that the language variety spoken by Kuringgai /Karikal (S62) belongs to the Hunter River  -   Lake Macquarie language S99, not Darug S64. \n\nWafer and Lissarrague (2008:162-163) distinguish between Fraser's 'super-language' usage of 'Kuringgai' (1892) and Capell's (1970) reference regarding a language spoken from north Sydney to Tuggerah Lakes on the Central Coast. The evidence suggests Kuringgai was spoken in the Central Coast region, extending south to Brisbane Waters. \n\nWafer and Lissarrague also summarise the case made by Smith (2004) which resolves the confusion regarding Kuringgai and Gameraigal: the latter is based on a place name in north Sydney, 'Gameray' (see also Attenbrow 2010), but there is no language data associated with people who originally lived there. The language generally associated with north Sydney is the one spoken by Bungaree and his people, who were from the region to the north of Broken Bay and moved to north Sydney in the early nineteenth century. They were speakers of the dialect now called Kuringgai (S62).",

The vocabulary items in the book appear to be Dhurga S53, though it is a very small sample. It is hard to tell whether this use of 'Yuin', then, refers to Dhurga S53, or to all the languages of the Yuin people (e.g. Thawa S52, Djirringany S51, Dharawal S59), or perhaps to a 'new' revival language with vocabulary taken from various Yuin languages.\n\nConsequently, Yuin is cautiously included as a language heading in the Thesaurus.",

Gardner (1996:5) and Hercus (1969), however, treat all of these as the names of groups whose language is Kurnai (S68).\n\nOn the other hand, Howitt (1996:73) gives distinct names for the dialects spoken by each of the clans of the Kurnai group: Muk-thang by the Brabralung S45, Thangquai by the Krauatungalung S48, and Nulit S91 by the Brayakaulung S41, Brataualung S39 and Tatungalung S42. Walsh (1981) largely follows this analysis, differing in his use of Muk-thang as the cover term S68 (as does Wesson (2002:106-7)) as well as one of the dialects S45, and with the addition of Bidhawal S49 as a fourth dialect. Of Bidawal S49, Howitt (1996:79-81) comments that it is a mixture of Kurnai, Ngarigo S46 and 'Murring' (i.e. a Yuin language).",

        "language_comment": "There is some uncertainty around the nature of the relationship between languages around the lower Murray River. According to Tindale (1974), Ngaiawang (S7) was sometimes grouped with Nganguruku S6 but the vocabularies show differences. McDonald (2002:15) comments that Ngaiawang, Ngaralti S4, Nganguruku and Ngawait S10 seem to be closely related each other, and Wafer and Lissarrague (2008) group them together under the 'Lower Riverland language'. Wafer and Lissarrague (2008:31) also note that these names are likely to be dialects rather than 'alternative designations', citing the distinct locations and differences in kinship terms described in Radcliffe-Brown (1918:243). The Mobile Language Team treats Ngayawang, Ngangaruku and Ngawadj S10 as distinct languages.\n\nThe term Meru is sometimes applied to Ngayawang and several other languages in the area, being the word for 'man' in those languages. Radcliffe-Brown (1918:246) notes that this includes the 'Nganguruku and Ngaiyan (S7)? languages, and probably those of the Nanait S10?, Yiran S12, Yuyu S19 and Ngintait S18 also'. Dowling (1990:25) remarks that 'the Jirawirung S12 and Ngawait were part of a major linguistic group, the Meru, which extended west along the Murray River from the Pyap Bend and south towards Lake Alexandrina (Tindale 1974) and included the Ngaiawang, Nganguruku and Ngintait speakers.'",

The five groups identified by Smith are Booandik S13, Pinechunga S78, Moatatunga S76, Wichantunga (S72) and Polijunga S79. Blake (2003:7), however, finds it impossible to align his sources of information with these dialects.\n\nOn the basis of Smith (1880), Wichintunga could be treated as a dialect of Buandig S13, but it may just be the name of a group whose language is Buandig (see Blake 2003:7). Note that Smith does not use Buandig as a cover term. \n\nBerndt and Berndt (1993) report what Tindale identifies as Meintangk S14 as being part of the 'Milipi' language. Tindale's location and alternative names for Meintangk roughly correspond to Smith's five groups, excepting perhaps Bungandidj S8 in name (but not entirely in location). Note that Berndt and Berndt (1993:305) mention there being both Milipi-speaking and non-Milipi speaking Pungadidji S13. Ward (in Campbell 1934:25) also makes a distinction between the Penganka S14 and Boandik S13 groups, 'who formerly occupied the country from Mount Gambier to Tatiara. The dominion of the Boandiks comprised the southerly portion of that area, and the Pengankas roamed from Penola northwards.' Milipi may be the name of the language Smith refers to.\n\nTaplin's (1879:142-52) language data for the 'Guichen Bay tribe' may be Wichintunga.",

In his Bunganditj sketch grammar, Blake (2003:xii) notes that the community has adopted the name Keerraywoorroong for this language.\n\nIn her 'Dictionary of Keerraywoorroong and related dialects', Krishna-Pillay (1996:17-18) describes seven closely related dialects but makes no mention of Wirngilgnad dhalinanong. The list of dialects partially overlaps with Blake's, with the addition of Thawoortwoorrong (Dhauhurtwurru) S20 and the omission of S71 and S80.\n\nThe Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages follows Clark in treating Keerray Woorroong as a separate language.",

Clark goes on to discuss the uncertain status of Mardidjali S16, meaning 'abrupt' or 'hard to understand' speech, which he says is probably a 'dialect of Jardwadjali or possibly Wergaia S27' (p. 237). In his later work, Clark (2005:14) includes all four varieties - Jardwadjali, Nundadjali, Jagwadjali and Mardidjali - as dialects of the same language, which he terms Jardwadjali (thus using Jardwadjali as both language and dialect name).\n\nDocumentation on Jardwadjali S27 may be relevant.",

Clark goes on to discuss the uncertain status of Mardidjali S16, meaning 'abrupt' or 'hard to understand' speech, which he says is probably a 'dialect of Jardwadjali or possibly Wergaia S27' (p. 237). In his later work, Clark (2005:14) includes all four varieties - Jardwadjali, Nundadjali, Jagwadjali and Mardidjali - as dialects of the same language, which he terms Jardwadjali (thus using Jardwadjali as both language and dialect name).\n\nDocumentation on Jardwadjali S27 may be relevant.",

        "language_comment": "According to Clark (2005:18), Waywurru is the name of the language spoken by the Pallanganmiddang. Blake and Reid (1999) use Pallanganmiddang as the language name. They describe its phonology and provide a word list.  \n\nClark (1996:17) says Waywurru has two 'sub-dialects', Kwart Kwart S97 and Mogullumbidj S90, the latter of which is treated as an alternative name of both Minjambuta S90 and Taungurong S37 by Tindale (1974). Clark (2005:18) later changes his position, however, listing Minjambuta S90 as the only dialect of Waywurru: Mogullumbidj is listed separately as an 'unnamed' Kulin language (apparently Mogullumbidj is a description, not a language name), and Kwart Kwart is listed under Yorta Yorta as a variant. Later still (2011:9), Clark says that Minjambuta is likely to be a variant of Minubuddong and, as such, is possibly a Wiradjuri D10 exonym for Pallanganmiddang.\n\nEira (2008:153-154) discusses the issue of establishing the identity of the historical data assembled for the programs, much of which is identified by location, rather than language name. For example, data being treated as Waywurru is variously labelled Pallanganmiddang, Upper Murray, Minubuddong, Kilure, Yackandandah, Wangaratta, Robertson, Andrews and Yackandandah Bank Museum. Data treated as Dhudhuroa is variously labelled Dhudhuroa and 'Barwidgee, from Wodonga along Upper Murray'. She points out that, 'given the likely reality of linguistic relationships prior to colonisation as well as the status of the 19th century records ... similarities between the lists and dissimilarities between the groups are sufficient to assert a basic division into two language groups without controversy.'\n\nLloyd (1985:1) mentions the name 'Whroo' (referencing Andrews 1920) which he says is 'a group of the Kwat Kwat, a branch of the Bangerang', noting that Lake Moodemere was their gathering place. Andrews (1920:35) locates the Whroo at Wahgunyah, a couple of kilometres to the north of Lake Moodemere. While Whroo may appear to be a permutation of the name Waywurru (S89, but previously treated as part of S40 with the former reference name Bangerang / Kwat Kwat / Waveroo), and the location would fit, Eira (2016 p.c.) suggests that 'whroo' is simply cognate with 'wurru/wurrung' meaning 'mouth' or 'language', a common component of language names in Victoria, and thus likely a mistake. (Note that there is a place called Whroo, though it is over 80 kilometres to the south-west of Lake Moodemere.) Robinson (in Clark 2003:160), the earliest source for Kwat Kwat, considered it a subgroup of Waveroo, but contemporary sources tentatively link it to Yorta Yorta (D2) as either a subgroup (Hagen 1997), dialect (Bowe 2002) or alternative name (Clark 2011). Eira also notes (2016 p.c.) that she has studied the Pallanganmiddang records (identified by the contemporary Waywurru (S89) community as Waywurru language) and they are not Yorta Yorta (D2) or Bangerang (S40). She suggests including Whroo as a possible alternative name for Kwat Kwat (S97) on the basis of Lloyd's description.",

        "location_information": "... the exact location is obscure, but it was spoken on the upper Murray and seems to have been close to Dhudhuroa (Blake & Reid 1995:5).\n\n... it was probably spoken to the south of Wodonga (Blake and Reid 1998:4).\n\nRobinson states that 'Pal ler an mit ter belong to the Noer.rar called Little River where Mr Huon station' (30 Septermeber 1844) and 'Country of the Bul ler an mit ter extend from W Bank of Hume to Ovens River N to Punderambo and then up towards the mountains' (MLA 7086, vol. 65, part3, p13). The Little River was subsequently renamed the Kiewa River and Huon's property included the area of the present town of Wodonga (Fels 1997:31). The Hume River is the Murray River. Curr (1886) places List No 213 to the east of Albury and Wodonga in the map contained in volume 4, and Smyth places Pallungan Middah close to Wodonga and east-southeast. Howitt includes a Balaung Karar on his map of the area west-southwest of Wodonga (1904:827). It is likely that Balaung equates with Pallang and it may be that Pallanganmiddang extended from east-southeast of Wodonga through Tangambalanga to an area west-southwest of Wodonga (Blake and Reid 1999:16). \n\n(Clark's map (1996) includes the area for Minjambuta (S90).",

This may mean that Wurm decided not to treat Ngarat as a language name, though the reference is dubious: Oates's 1975 bibliography lists Wurm 1970 as Languages of Australia and Tasmania, but this is Wurm 1972.\n\nEither way, there is insufficient evidence of Ngarad as a language name.

        "language_comment": "Previously Kwat Kwat was incorporated into S40 (formerly 'Bangerang / Kwat Kwat / Waveroo'). However, very little is known about this name and sources vary as to its status as a language name and its identity with respect to other groups. Some sources have treated Kwat Kwat as a distinct language variety.\n\nClark (1996) treats Kwart Kwart (S97) as a 'subdialect' of Waywurru S89, though in later publications he changes his position, linking it to Yorta Yorta D2. The nature of this link, however, is not clear. In Clark (2005) Kwart Kwart is termed a variant of Yorta Yorta, which could mean a dialect or an alternative name. Clark (2005) says his view is supported by Bowe and Morey (1999) but they say that Kwat Kwat is a 'sub-group of the Yorta Yorta/Bangerang macro-group' (p.5, fn. 7). Clark (2011) calls Kwart Kwart 'a cognate' of Yorta Yorta, but it is not clear if he means the names are cognate or the language varieties are related. Bowe (2002) admits  the possibility that 'Kwat Kwat / Quart Quart / Quarta Quarta' may be a slight variation of the name 'Yorta Yorta', though she seems to lean towards it being a dialect rather than an alternative name.\n\nAll sources acknowledge the uncertainty of this name and many surveys omit it entirely (Dixon 2002, Oates and Oates 1970, Capell 1963). Bowe (2002:140) points out that, without language data, it is impossible to know 'whether Quart Quart \"language\" was a dialect, or a set of dialects, of the macro-language grouping Bangerang/Yorta Yorta, or a dialect of some other language, though the former seems to be the most likely.'\n\nLloyd (1985:1) mentions the name 'Whroo' (referencing Andrews 1920) which he says is 'a group of the Kwat Kwat, a branch of the Bangerang', noting that Lake Moodemere was their gathering place. Andrews (1920:35) locates the Whroo at Wahgunyah, a couple of kilometres to the north of Lake Moodemere. While Whroo may appear to be a permutation of the name Waveroo/Waywurru (S89, but previously treated as part of S40 with the former reference name Bangerang / Kwat Kwat / Waveroo), and the location would fit, Eira (2016 p.c.) suggests that 'whroo' is simply cognate with 'wurru/wurrung' meaning 'mouth' or 'language', a common component of language names in Victoria, and thus likely a mistake. (Note that there is a place called Whroo, though it is over 80 kilometres to the south-west of Lake Moodemere.) Robinson (in Clark 2003:160), the earliest source for Kwat Kwat, considered it a subgroup of Waveroo, but contemporary sources tentatively link it to Yorta Yorta (D2) as either a subgroup (Hagen 1997), dialect (Bowe 2002) or alternative name (Clark 2011). Eira also notes (2016 p.c.) that she has studied the Pallanganmiddang records (identified by the contemporary Waywurru (S89) community as Waywurru language) and they are not Yorta Yorta (D2) or Bangerang (S40). She suggests including Whroo as a possible alternative name for Kwat Kwat (S97) on the basis of Lloyd's description.",

        "language_comment": "The language from the region known as Hunter River and Lake Macquarie to the north of Sydney is known from the work of the Rev Lancelot Threlkeld (1788-1859) who established a mission at Lake Macquarie between 1826 - 1841. Threlkeld studied the language under the guidance of Biraban, also known as Johnny McGill, who later worked as an interpreter in court cases involving Aboriginal people.\n\nThrelkeld's major descriptions of the language from the Hunter River and Lake Macquarie region published in 1834 and 1850 were later rearranged, condensed and edited by Fraser, his version was published in 1892. It includes a new orthography (writing system) designed by Fraser, who named language  'Awabakal' S66 which has since been adopted by the community (1892:preface).\n\nArposio (2008:10) describes Awabakal S66 as a dialect within a larger language group including Gadhang E67 to the north and extending southwards from Newcastle down the coast to the northern shores of Botany Bay, reflecting Fraser's (1892) 'Kuringgai' group.\n\nLissarrague describes the Hunter River  -  Lake Macquarie language (S99) spoken by people now known as Awabakal S66, Kuringgai S62, Wonnarua S63 and possibly Geawegal E1 (2006:8).\n\nIn Wafer and Lissarrague, Awabakal S66 is treated as a dialect name of the Hunter River  -  Lake Macquarie language, the other dialects being Wanarruwa S63 and Karikal S62, the latter is also known as Kurringgai, which Wafer and Lissarrague speculate is another invention of Fraser (2008:159 - 160). Their paper in 2010 disambiguates the different uses of this term.\n\nWafer and Lissarrague (2008) also address the confusion over the relationship between the Hunter River  -  Lake Macquarie language (S99) (i.e. Wanarruwa 63, Karikal ~ Kuringgai S62, Kayawaykal E1) and the 'Lower North Coast language' (i.e. Gathang E67, Birrpay E3, Warrimay E2 and Guringay E95), indicating these are two distinct languages.",

According to Crowley and Dixon (1981:403), Northern (i.e. the region east of Circular Head T12 and west of Port Sorell T13) is probably a language on its own, although the figure of 50 percent common vocabulary with Piper River T14 (with which it is not contiguous) does not discount it being a dialect of the same language. \n\nCrowley (1993:54) concludes from examination of vocabulary lists and comments from colonial observations about who could and who could not understand each other that at least eight separate languages and possibly as many as twelve belong to Tasmania. Crowley and Dixon ((1981:404) conclude there is no evidence to indicate a single Tasmanian language family, available evidence indicates two, four or even eight distinct families.

Crowley and Dixon ((1981:404) conclude there is no evidence to indicate a single Tasmanian language family, available evidence indicates two, four or even eight distinct families. Bowern (2012) groups twelve languages into four language macro-families (northeastern, Oyster Bay, southeastern (Bruny) and western) using methods from evolutionary biology to systematically investigate vocabularies, from thirty five language lists.\n\nCrowley and Dixon (1981:402-403) compare collected vocabularies from fifteen regions.

        "language_comment": "The Tasmanian languages/dialects records are sparse. Crowley and Dixon (1981:402) say that Piper River T14, Cape Portland (T9) and Ben Lomond T7 form an 'interrelated group' - either the first two, or all three, could be dialects of a single language. However if Ben Lomand T7 is a separate language, it is likely to be 'genetically related' to Piper River T14 and Cape Portland (T9).\n\nCrowley (1993:54) concludes from examination of vocabulary lists and comments from colonial observations about who could and who could not understand each other  that at least eight separate languages and possibly as many as twelve belong to Tasmania. Crowley and Dixon (1981:404) conclude there is no evidence to indicate a single Tasmanian language family, available evidence indicates two, four or even eight distinct families. Bowern (2012) groups twelve languages into four language macro-families (northeastern, Oyster Bay, southeastern (Bruny) and western) using methods from evolutionary biology to systematically investigate vocabularies, from thirty five language lists.\n\nCrowley and Dixon (1981:402-403) compare collected vocabularies from fifteen regions. This database assigns reference names for Tasmania based on this regional list. See also Northern T1; Oyster Bay T2; North-western T3; Northern Midlands T4; South-eastern  T5; Macquarie Harbour T6; Ben Lomond T7; Big River T8; South-western T10; Robbin Island T11; Circular Head T12; Port Sorrell T13; Piper River T14 and Little Swanport T15.\n\nThe areas defined as Cape Portland (T9), Ben Lomond  T7 and Piper River T14 in Crowley and Dixon's map (1981:394) roughly coincide with the area defined as Pyemmairrener by Horton in the AIATSIS map of Aboriginal Australia. Cape Portland Tasmanian language data, along with historical sources from all Tasmanian languages and dialects, form the basis of palawa kani language T16 construction.",

The Noongar Boodjar Waangkiny Language Centre assigns the Balardong (W10) clan to the 'Djiraly: Northern' dialect, noting the approximate nature of 'how the original 14 recognised Noongar Clans have been drawn into 3 main dialects'.\n\nLanguage data by Hackett in Curr (1886) is identified as that of the 'Ballardong or Ballerdokking' group, and records for several Daisy Bates items not held in the AIATSIS collection contain the Ballardong language heading. Ballardong has been treated as a Noongar / Nyungar W41 dialect in past classifications and several Noongar / Nyungar community web sites treat it as a language variety. Note, however, that there is a place called Balladong.\n\nDouglas (e.g. 1976:5-6) makes no reference to Ballardong but does mention a dialect called Tjapanmay A92, the location of which ('New Norcia - Goomalling area') corresponds to part of the location Tindale (1974) describes for Balardong (W10). Further, Tindale mentions that the name 'Tap:anmai, instead of Balardong, is used at Goomalling.

Douglas (1968) does not include it in his description of Nju?ar W41. See record for Noongar / Nyungar W41 for a discussion about the relationship between Noongar / Nyungar people names and language/dialect names.\n\nAt the 1990 Wellington Mills Conference, organised by the Nyoongar Language Project Advisory Panel, it was agreed on that there are (at least) three dialects of Nyoongar W41. Bernard Rooney's 2011 'Nyoongar dictionary' primarily represents the 'north-western' dialect, spoken in the Moora district of the Nyoongar country, identified as '(Yued/Yuat)' (W11) in the subtitle. (Rooney 2011:2-3)\n\nThe Noongar Boodjar Waangkiny Language Centre assigns the Juat (W11) clan to the 'Djiraly: Northern' dialect, noting the approximate nature of 'how the original 14 recognised Noongar Clans have been drawn into 3 main dialects'.",

This may be due to some sources treating the various names for Nhanhagardi A93 and Naaguja A101 as alternative names for Amangu. Oates (1975) treats Nanagarri A93 and Nanakati A93 as variants of a language she calls Amangu/Njaagurdi, perhaps because of their similarity with 'Njaagurdi' A101?, but Douglas (1976) says that Nanakati A93 is a dialect of Noongar / Nyoongar W41. Brandenstein (1967, PMS 2125), too, seems to allude to Naaguja A101 and Nanakati A93 possibly being the same. However, Douglas reports Nanakati A93 as being the language from the Mingenew area whereas Naaguja (and variants), by contrast, is associated with the coast. Like Oates, Blevins (2001) treats Nhaaguja A101, Njaagurdi A93? and Nyaakurti A93? as alternative names of Amangu, but says that Amangu is a Nhanda W14 language.\n\nDocumentation on Nhanda / Nanda W14 may be relevant.",

O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966:37) link Watjanti with Malgana W18, Targuda W15, Buluguda W17 and Damala W16 as dialects/communalects. Douglas (MS 1369:2) says the data on Watjandi (W13) in Curr is obviously closely related to Watjarri A39. He says the name Watjandi is not known by Watjarri A39 speakers in the Murchison today; they call the people at the sea end of the Murchison River either 'Wirlunyu' (Wirlunju) or 'Tja Urra'.

Thus Nhanda is both a language name and a dialect name. Marmion (2007 p.c.) says that Ngukaja A101 reported by Gratte (PMS 5968, PMS 4878, MS 4134) might be a dialect of Nhanda as well. Tindale (1974) lists Buluguda W17 and Daguda W15 as group names of Nanda (W14). However, according to Blevins (2001:2), Buluguda and Daguda are likely local groups of Malgana W18.\n\nHowever, the identity of both Amangu W12 and Watjanti W14 is somewhat uncertain. The South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council's Kaartdijin Noongar page lists Amangu as a 'Noongar dialectical group'. Most sources consider Amangu to be related to Nhanda, but Nhanhagardi A93, which is equated with Amangu by several sources (including Blevins), is treated as a dialect of Noongar / Nyungar W41 by Douglas (1976). Douglas (1981) also says that, based on his comparison of the data supplied in Curr, Watjanti W13 is clearly closely related to Watjarri A39.",

The WA Handbook treats Buluguda as a language name, citing a word list in Wells (1893) 'Vocabularies of words and phrases with translations', pp. 192-207 in the Journal of the Elder Scientific Exploration Expedition. O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966:37) group Buluguda with Targuda W15, Damala W16, Watjanti W13 and Malgana W14 as communalects. Gargett (2011:2-3) ventures that they were likely groups of Malgana, the names referring to locations rather than distinct groups, but he cautions that more evidence is needed to substantiate this claim.\n\nAddressing Tindale's (1974) analysis of Damala, Buluguda and Daguda being groups of Nhanda, Blevins (2001) - supplying their respective variant spellings Thaamala W16, Bulugurda (W17) and Thaagurda W15 - says that they are likely 'local groups of Malgana' and that this view is supported by Nhanda people in the Northhampton area.",

O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966:37) group them as dialects/communalects with Malgana. Tindale (1974) equates them with Nhanda W14 as alternative names or place names. According to Blevins (2001), Buluguda W17 and Daguda W15 are local groups of Malgana. Gargett (2011:2-3) ventures that they are likely groups of Malgana, the names referring to locations rather than distinct groups, but he cautions that more evidence is needed to substantiate this claim.\n\nGargett (2011:3) notes that no comparison of Malgana with surrounding languages has previously been undertaken, and that the results of his comparison are only 'suggestive' due to the very limited amount of data available (330 items - comparative wordlists are given in an appendix to his grammar). He gives scores of lexical similarity for Nhanda W14 (46%), Wajarri A39 (58%), Yingkarta W19 (46%), and Badimaya A14 (43%). Gargett remarks that the slightly higher score for Wajarri may reflect that the data is relatively more recent than for the other languages, the data is skewed in terms of semantic category coverage, and that there was traditionally a close connection and bilingualism between these two groups.",

In fact, in 'Proto-Kanyara and proto-Mantharta historical phonology', after detailing the dialectal variation in Dhalandji W26 and Dhargari W21, Austin writes that 'there is no other variation to be found in any other language', referring to the group of eight languages on the map on page 297, Burduna among them (pp. 296-97).",

Austin also mentions that O'Grady collected material on the different dialects in 1958 and 1967.\n\nAustin (1988) includes Jinigudira W54 as one of the Thalanyji 'groups', noting that Tindale treats them as a different 'tribe'.  There is some uncertainty around the identity of this name. Tindale (1974) says that Jinigudira W54 people spoke a language close to Talandji (W26) and were sometimes considered to be 'western Talandji', however his informants were sure that they had possessed separate identities for a long time. Von Brandenstein (1969, pMS 2139), on the other hand, reports that it may be a dialect of Pajungu W23, while Deak (2008 p.c.) says her informant suspects that Yinigudira W54 is probably not a group of people or language, but a sacred site for the Bayungu W23.\n\nDeak notes that there are suggestions of two different dialects of Thalanyji, though reports vary and Deak's informants deny any dialectal differences, suggesting instead that variant forms may be attributable to other Ganyara languages.

(Wangka Maya 2008:iv).\n\nContemporary location: Today, Thalanyji people, some of whom are able to use the Bayungu language, live predominantly in Carnarvon or Port Hedland.

There is a Latukefu (Fink) item in the AIATSIS collection (MS 46) which contains a reference to a 'Janari song' from the Roebourne district, without any further information about the name.\n\nAccording to Dench (1990, in Wangka Maya 2001:9), Yarnarri is one of five dialects of Kurrama W36, the others being Yinyjiwarnti Kurrama W60, Mijarranypa W61, Marntartka W62 and Ngamangamara W63.\n\nThe Wangka Maya web site lists Yarnarri as a dialect of Kurrama but Janari and Yanari as alternatives for Yindjibarndi, while the WA Handbook lists Janari as an alternative name of Nyiyaparli A50.",

The north-eastern boundary between the Martuthunira, Ngarluma and Yapurarra/Pijurru is marked by a group of three hills - Mount Leopold, Moondle Hill and Mount McLeod - just to the south of the Maitland River. On the Fortescue River, the Martuthunira extended as far inland as Booloomba Pool, though much of the gorge country was shared with the Kurrama and Yindjibarndi. The ancient river valley linking the Robe and Fortescue Rivers, in the shadow of Mount Elvire, effectively represents the south-eastern boundary with the Kurrama. The Robe River (Jajiwurra), Jimmawurrada Creek and the Buckland Hills were also Martuthunira. Warluru Pool, where the Robe River leaves the Mamersley Range, marks the eastern extent of Martuthunira country. Warluru also marks the eastern boundary between Kurrama and Pinikura, whose country borders the Maruthunira in the Buckland Hills from Warluru to Chalyarn Pool on the Robe. The Nhuwala and Pinikura meet nearby at Darnell Hill. Ono the west coast, the grass plaiins and mudflats between the Robe River and the Cane River were shared with the Nhuwala. Warramboo Creek (Wartampu) is described as the boundary althought the Nhuwala foraged as far to the north-east as the Robe River (Dench 1995:2).\n\nContemporary location: Onslow, Karratha and surrounding towns, Tom Price, Port Hedland",

It appears that Nyungar, the alternative spelling of Noongar, is more widely used by linguists.\n\nThe following names have been associated with Noongar / Nyungar: Nyaki Nyaki A1, Bibbulman W1, Yuat W11, Minang W2, Wardandi W3, Kaniyang W4, Goreng W5, Pinjarup W6, Wiilman W7, Wudjari W8, Wajuk W9, Balardung W10 and Tjapanmay A92. (Note that Vaszolyi (PMS 1945) compiles a list of 25 'speech form' names associated with Njungar (W41) from four different sources: Douglas 1968, Oates 1968, O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin 1966 and Capell 1963.)\n\nSome sources, such as Dixon (2002), treat these as the names of groups of people whose language is Noongar / Nyungar, others such as O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966) treat them as language names of a Noongar / Nyungar subgroup, and yet others (Douglas 1976) treat (some of) them as dialect names of a Noongar / Nyungar language. Whitehurst (1992:iii) says 'Noongar has about 12 dialects', and Rooney (2011:16, The Nyoongar legacy) mentions that the Nyoongar Language Conferences established that there were about 14 pre-contact dialects of the language, of which only three could now be identified.\n\nThe Noongar Boodjar Waangkiny Language Centre notes that 'sometimes people use clan names for dialect names to ensure readers know the country and the people their stories belong to'. The centre's web site describes three main dialects: Djiraly - Northern, Kongal-marawar - South-western, and Kongal-boyal - South-eastern, and notes that 'the dialect regions are an approximation of how the original 14 recognised Noongar Clans have been drawn into 3 main dialects.'\n\nBernard Rooney's 2011 Nyoongar dictionary primarily represents the 'north-western' dialect, spoken in the Moora district of Nyoongar country, identified as 'Yued/Yuat' W11 in the subtitle. It is catalogued with both Noongar / Nyungar and Yuat W11 language headings.\n\nIn this database, each of the Noongar / Nyungar names is treated as both group name and, tentatively, dialect name.",

Austin (1988) also says there are two varieties of Yingkarta, a northern and a southern. He mentions two Yingkarta group names, Manthi W42 and Thirrily (W46), the locations of which appear to correspond to a north  -  south division, though he does not say that these group names are also the names of the dialects. Further, in his 1992 dictionary, Austin refers to the two dialects as Northern Yinggarda W42 and Southern Yinggarda (W46).\n\nThe language name with code W46 was formerly Thirrily.

This is based on von Brandenstein's research, who also mentions that there is minimal difference between East Ngarluma and West Ngarluma, and that all his informants spoke East Ngarluma (von Brandenstein 1966:2, PMS 2130).\n\nFollowing von Brandenstein, Yapurarra is classified as a dialect of Ngarluma.",

However, it is impossible to be sure: besides Tindale, there is no information about the name Wiludjanu and, according to the WA Handbook, von Brandenstein (p.c.) reports the last speaker of Nugan dying in 1967.\n\nNokaan, Nugan and Nhugarn (the latter treated separately in this database as A71) are likely to be variant spellings of the same name. The location given for Nhugarn A71 by Marmion (1996) largely matches that described for Nokaan in Tindale (1974). Von Brandenstein (1974) presents transcriptions of recordings which he identifies as 'Nugan' but also links to the name Taakurda W15. His 1966 manuscript explains that Nugan is an alternative name for Taakurda W15. Though Nhugarn is identified as a dialect of Wajarri A39 in Marmion (1996), Marmion (2007 p.c.) notes that there is little language data available and its identity with respect to Daguda W15 is uncertain.\n\nNhugarn, Nugan and Nokaan are grouped under the same heading (A71) in the Thesaurus.\n\nDocumentation for Daguda W15 and Wajarri A39 may be relevant.",

Davidson's 'Comparative vocabularies of nineteen Western Australian Language' manuscript (MS 1097) contains  language data for Yabberu (W55), also in keyboarded form in Nash (PMS 6179).\n\nVon Brandenstein (1967) glosses Jaburru as 'north' when noting the prominence of compass-point naming conventions in Wadjarri A39 country, in addition to Wardal A19 as 'east' and Pidungu A40 as 'west'. Daisy Bates (MS 94:8) also notes that Yabbaroo means 'north' and that it is a term 'used by all the southern tribes from Perth along the coast almost to Cossack' (in the Pilbara). Note however that she also uses it as a specific group name, and that this is a different identity to Jaburu (W55).\n\nThe use of this term over a wide area, from the south-west up to the Pilbara, is also reported by Tindale (1974), who gives Jaburu as an alternative name for six different names: Wiilman W7, Widi A13, Kalaamaya A4, Nhanhagardi A93, Yuat W11 and Inggarda W19.\n\nGiven the relative reference of this name, it is hard to be sure of its identity.

The name contains the -up suffix, meaning 'place of' (The Kodja Place 2005), suggesting that this is a place name, not a language name. The Noongar Boodjar Waangkiny Language Centre assigns the Pindjarup (W6) clan to the 'Kongal-marawar: South-western' dialect, noting the approximate nature of 'how the original 14 recognised Noongar Clans have been drawn into 3 main dialects'.\n\nHowever, there is language data by Scott in Curr (1886) and in several Daisy Bates items not held in the AIATSIS collection, it has been treated as a Noongar / Nyungar W41 dialect in past classifications, and several Noongar / Nyungar community web sites treat it as a language variety.",

Dench (1995) notes the ambiguity of von Brandenstein's use of this term with respect to Jaurnmalu W70. Von Brandenstein appears to use Jaurnmalu, Purnukundi W68 and Marndanjingu W69 either interchangeably as people and language names (pp. 19-20), or as names of peoples whose language is Jindjiparndi W37. (See 'Language - Tribe' maps at the end of the publication.)\n\nBy contrast, Wordick (1982), who worked intensively on Yindjibarndi, says there is essentially no dialectal variation in Yindjibarndi, nor does he mention any of the names given by von Brandenstein.\n\nTindale gives a very similar form to Jaurnmalu, 'Jawunmala', as an alternative name for both Martuthunira W35 and Noala W30, and the slightly different 'Jawunmara' as an alternative name for Kurama W36. In all cases he notes that it is an Indjibandi W37 form. Oates (1975) notes that Jaurnmalu runs parallel to coastal Mardudhunira W35.",

See record for Noongar / Nyungar W41 for a discussion about the relationship between Noongar / Nyungar people names and language/dialect names.\n\nVon Brandenstein (1988) reports that what is now known as the Noongar / Nyungar language emerged because of a socio-political crisis that divided a group of people previously known as the 'shell people', with the Wudjari distancing themselves from the Nungurra through linguistic engineering (metathesis of non-final syllables). This new speech variety (which acquired the name Nyungar) then spread throughout much of the south-east of WA as a result of various population movements. This would imply that the language of the Wudjari people is Noongar / Nyungar.\n\nKwetjman by Wurm (1994) and Gwedjman by Oates (1975) are included here on the basis of Tindale's alternative of Wudjari, 'Kwaitjman', as well as the location of Kwaitjman given by Douglas (1968), and the location of Wudjari given by Tindale. This may perhaps have been the name of the language variety spoken by the 'shell people' (both Wudjari and Nungurra divisions) prior to the split.\n\nOf Gwedjman, Oates (1975:90) says that this could be an alternative of Goreng W5 or another Njungar W41 dialect, though there appears to be no evidence of its relationship to Goreng.\n\nThe Noongar Boodjar Waangkiny Language Centre assigns the Wudjari clan to the 'Kongal-boyal  -  South-eastern' dialect, noting the approximate nature of 'how the original 14 recognised Noongar Clans have been drawn into 3 main dialects'.",

Y25 as closely related dialects. \nHale's comparison of kinship terms collected by McConnel (1950) indicates his data for Mpalityan? correspond with hers for L?:tig (Y25) and her data for Tepti Y15 corresponds to his for Lut?u? (Y12) (1964:252-3). \n\nOates says that Debidigh Y15 is the same as Ludhigh (Y12) (1975:268 382). Dixon treats Luthigh (Y12) and Mpalitjanh Y25 two as separate dialects (2002:xxxi).",

The origin of the term Winduwinda is geographical, centering on the Winda Winda Creek area and covering groups with lands between the Archer and Mission Rivers (Sutton, 2001:460).\n\nThere are some data for Mpalityan? (T25) in Hale (1976: 8-9), who identifies similarities in vocabulary with Lut?u? Y12 but describes differences in phonological developments. In an earlier work he describes Mpalityan? and Lut?u? Y12 as closely related dialects; his comparison of kinship terms collected by McConnel (1950) indicates his data for Mpalityan? correspond with hers for L?:tig (Y25) and her data for Tepti Y15 corresponds to his for Lut?u?

        "language_comment": "Meryam Mir (Y3) is a traditional language from the Torres Strait Islands, specifically throughout the Eastern Islands of Erub (Darnley Island), Ugar (Stephen Island) and Mer (Murray Island). The name is constructed with the word mir 'word, language' and the name of a clan living on Mer, the Meryam people: Mer + -yam '(? ) of a clan, of a place'.  Meryam Mir has agglutinative morphology, and extensive system of cross-reference markers on the verb encoding information about the number, person and syntactic nature of the arguments and inflections on nouns to indicate syntactic function. In typological terms it is a double-marking language. It is classified by Wurm (in Piper) as a Papuan language of the Trans-Fly group, in close genetic relationships with the Eastern Trans-Fly family languages Bine, Gidra and Gizra (Piper, 2013:1). The Meryam people are ethnically Melanesian; they won Native Title for Mer in the historical Mabo case of 1992 (Passi and Piper 1994:321).\n\nThe spelling 'Meriam Mir' is used in this database in accordance with common practice.\n\nSee also Kala Lagaw Ya Y1, Kala Kawaw Ya Y2 and Torres Strait Creole P2.",

This database follows that convention.\nUmbindhamu (Y50) was described as being a 'Lamalamic' language by Laycock (1969:72). However, its classification was later redefined by Rigsby as a language which showed convergence towards the Lamalamic languages (Rimanggudinhma Y195, Morrobolam Y55 and Mbarrumbathama Y136) but retained evidence of a separate genetic lineage (in Godman 1993:18).

Within this subgroup, Morrobolam and Lamalama form a phonologically innovative branch, while Rumanggudinhma forms a more conservative branch' (Verstraete, 2018:1-2).\nMorrobolam is the name of a clan who speak a language also known by the exonym Umbuygamu (Y55).

Western Ayapathu only recently became known. According to Rigsby (2005), Yintjingka, a language name reported by Thomson, is the Indigenous name for the area around Port Stewart and the language Thomson reported in this area is coastal Ayapathu. Previously, coastal Ayapathu was not included as a separate record in AUSTLANG but it now has a distinct code Y236.\n\nAfter in-depth study of all available materials, Verstraete and Rigsby (2015) adopt the use of Yintyingka as the name of both the variety previously identified as coastal Ayapathu and as the language name, of which Ayapathu and Yintyingka (previously Coastal Ayapathu) Y236 are dialects. They reason (pp. 14-15) that Yintyingka is connected with the 'earliest and largest body of work', it is 'best established in ethnographic literature', and it avoids ambiguity with the 'structurally different' Western Ayapathu Y181.",

This possibly follows West, who described Wurangung and Parimankutinma as dialects of the same language. According to Bruce Rigsby the language West recorded c1960 is Kuku Thaypan Y84 (pers. comm. in Godman 1993:7) and is not included for analysis by Godman in her 1993 study of Rumanggudinhma Y195.\n\nIn his language map, Laycock places Parimankutinma and Wurungang under a 'Wurangung subgroup' (Laycock, 1969:71, 95, 97). It is interesting to note Laycock's Parimankutinma informants are also described as speakers of '... this language Parimankutinma or Wurangung' (1969:75). One of these people is Frank Curr, who was the speaker of 'Wurangung' recorded by  West.",

Yirrq+Yirront is a compound yirrq 'speech, language, group' and yorront, which has various interpretations, the most compelling from 'yorr' sand (of sandridges) and refers to people of the western (seaward) fringe of this country; an alternative name for this group and language is Yirr-Thuchm from thuch 'sandridge'. Neighbouring people (inland up the Mitchell River) speak Kin-Kopl, a variety of Yir-Yoront; some of the Kin-Kopl groups were originally speakers of Yirrk-Thangalkl Y214, described as a sister dialect of Yir-Yoront (Alpher, 1991:3-4).",

Of these, the people living closest to the beach are known as pamlopm. The Yir Tjutjm are given as living on the southern part of Wallaby Island, the Kin Kopol to the east of the North Mitchell River, and the Yir Thangedl at the mouth of the South Mitchell River. People who characterize themselves as Yir Tjutjm say their territory is \"Main Mitchell\", or near the mouth of the Main Mitchell. Those designated by others as Kin Kopol usually refer to themselves as Yir Tjutjm, and apply the term Kin Kopol to groups father east, like the Yir Mayin (Alpher 1973:5). \n\nAbout mouth of Coleman River and the three widely separated mouths of the Mitchell River, extending along the coast between them and inland to about the limits of tidal waters.

So the correspondence indicated between 'Kokowalandja' and 'Kuku Yalanji' is merely one of territory.

Two other speakers, the late Mrs Lucy Tommy and the late Mrs Doris Lawrence sometimes called this language variety Uw Inal (the name in Kunjen Y83). Sommer indicates that Koko Dhawa resembles Kok Kaber Y85, with which it shares 60% core vocabulary, making it a separate language but sharing membership in the 'Nassau' or 'South West Peninsula' subgroup (1997:1).\n\nSharp places Dhawa with inland groups including Ogh Undjan Y206 and Olgol Y73 on the basis of shared social organisation, and not with Kok Kaber Y85, the closest linguistic relation (1939 in Sommer 1997:1-2).\n\nOates lists Gugu Dhaw (Y93) under the Coastal Pama Sub-group, consisting of Gugu Dhaw (Pititj) (Y93) and Gugu Bera Y85 (1975:292). Koko-dauwer (Y93) is also called Koko-Wansin (Roth in Sharp, 1934:407).",

While its literal meaning is 'good language', in some contexts the inference is closer to 'intelligible, spoken by friends' (2005:138, 142). Kuku Mini is also associated with the names Akoonkoon and Koogo batha (Rigsby, p.c. 2007).\n\nKuku Mini (Y94) is classified as belonging to the Alaya-Athima language group, a set of initial-dropping languages not closely related to others of this type in the area. Alpher describes them in regional blocks, with Koko Mini located in the centre of the group, in the area between the Mitchell and Palmer Rivers. He indicates that Kookobatha may be linguistically distinct.\n\nOther members of this group include Awu Alaya (Kuku Thaypan) Y84 ; Aghu Tharrnggala Y65; Awu Arungu / Awu Alwang / Agu Aloja Y219; Ogh Alungul Y199;  Ogh Angkula 197;  Ikarranggal Y198;  Takalak Y125; Ogh Awarrangg Y201; Ongunyjan Y206; Kokiny Y188; Athima Y237 (Alpher, 2016:41-42).",

        "language_comment": "The name Jalunju has several variants, largely differentiated by the use of the letter 'j' versus 'y'. Oates and Oates 1970 do not distinguish between these variants, identifying Jalunju as Y99 along with variants Ialuniu, Yalunyu and Jalung). Oates 1975, however, treats Jalunju and Yalunyu differently: Jalunju as an alternative of Gugu Gulunggur Y103 (along with Jalung) and Yalunyu as an alternative of Gugu Yalanji Y78.\n\nTo further complicate matters, Tindale 1974 treats Yalunyu and Yalung (both treated as the same by Oates and Oates 1970) as distinct: Yalunyu as an alternative of Jungkurara Y89 (along with Ialiu, Ialunia and several others) and Yalung as an alternative of Kulunggur Y103.\n\nMcConnel (1939:66) also treats Yalunyu and Yalung as distinct, describing 'the Koko-yanyu (lower Bloomfield), Koko-yalunyu (upper Bloomfield and Daintree) and Koko-yalung (lower Daintree)' as distinct groups. In her 1931 article about a moon legend, McConnel supplies some Yalunyu (Y99) language data. Confusingly, though, she says these three groups correspond to Roth's (1901-1906) 'Koko-baldja', which would presumably be modern Wulpura Y98.\n\nSutton (2001:10) identifies Kuku-Nyungkul Y90, Kuku-Yanyu Y92 and Kuku-Yalunyu (Y99) as dialects of Kuku Yalanji Y78, though Patz (2002) does not mention Kuku-Yalunyu in her study on Kuku Yalanji.\n\nNote that this record has been merged with the record for Y166*, which are almost certain to be the same.",
